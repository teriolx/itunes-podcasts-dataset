# iTunes Podcasts Dataset

This repository contains code to preprocess the [iTunes podcasts metadata dataset](https://github.com/odenizgiz/Podcasts-Data) according to the process described in the research paper [Topic Modeling on Podcast Short-Text Metadata](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-99736-6_32). This dataset is then used in reproducing the results from the research paper in our article [Reproducibility of "Topic Modeling on Podcast Short-Text Metadata"](https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10580257).

## Structure

* `iTunes.ipynb` contains the source code for the preprocessing of the dataset

* `itunes.tsv` is the resulting dataset file after preprocessing
