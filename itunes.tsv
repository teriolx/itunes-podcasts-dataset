Board Game Design Lab	The Board Game Design Lab came into existence for a very simple reason: I could never find the game design info that I needed. And I assumed I wasn't the only one. I had a lot of very specific questions I wanted to ask game designers and publishers, and as it turns out, they're more than happy to answer those questions when asked. So, I created the BGDL Podcast. I release a weekly show that interviews designers, publishers, and board game insiders on specific topics. We don't waste time talking about games we've played lately or get caught up on pop culture. There are plenty of other podcasts that do those things very well. Instead, the show does a deep dive into subjects that I hope listeners find extremely valuable as they progress through their game design journeys. The show comes out on Wednesdays.

Singularity	"What if the cataclysmic Tunguska explosion of 1908 was caused, not by a meteor or a comet, but by a microscopic black hole?

What if  that fantastic object - smaller than an atom, older than the stars, heavier than a mountain - is still down there, orbiting deep inside the earth, slowly consuming the planet?

What if  only a rookie government agent and an uncannily-insightful consultant stand between a renegade Russian billionaire and his plans to use the black hole to change history - or end it?

What if  it's all true?

For an alternative view of the Tunguska event and to explore the science behind Singularity, visit  the Vurdalak Conjecture website.

Working under the government's shroud of secrecy, CIA operative Dew Phillips crisscrosses the country trying in vain to capture a live victim. With only decomposing corpses for clues, CDC epidemiologist Margaret Montoya races to analyze the science behind this deadly contagion. She discovers that these killers all have one thing in common - they've been contaminated by a bioengineered parasite, shaped by a complexity far beyond the limits of known science.

Meanwhile Perry Dawsey - a hulking former football star now resigned to life as a cubicle-bound desk jockey - awakens one morning to find several mysterious welts growing on his body. Soon Perry finds himself acting and thinking strangely, hearing voices . . . he is infected.

The fate of the human race may well depend on the bloody war Perry must wage with his own body, because the parasites want something from him, something that goes beyond mere murder."

More Teachings - The Harvest	"This is the Torah Observant ""Shomer Mitzvot"" series.  In Judaism, safeguarding and keeping the Torah is central to performing the will of HaShem.  Indeed, as properly understood from HaShem’s point of view, the whole of Torah was given to bring its followers to the ""goal"" of acquiring the kind of faith in HaShem that leads to placing one’s trusting faithfulness in the One and only Son of HaShem, Yeshua HaMashiach.  To this end, the Torah has prophesied about him since as early as the book of Genesis (3:15), and continues to speak of him until its conclusion in Revelation (22:20). In this capacity, the Torah acts like its etymological counterpart ""yarah""  (an archery term) in that it ""teaches"" its adherents how to properly identify with HaShem by helping them to ""reach the mark.” To be sure, one of the most common Hebrew verbs used to identify sin “chatah” literally means, ""to miss the mark.”"

Out of Dominion was born its bastard child – or perhaps its immaculate conception – the Moby-Dick Big Read: an online version of Melville’s magisterial tome: each of its 135 chapters read out aloud, by a mixture of the celebrated and the unknown, to be broadcast online, one new chapter each day, in a sequence of 135 downloads, publicly and freely accessible.
Starting 16 September 2012!

According to Vedanta, God is infinite existence, infinite consciousness, and infinite bliss. The term for this impersonal, transcendent reality is Brahman, the divine ground of being. Yet Vedanta also maintains that God can be personal as well, assuming human form in every age.
Vedanta further asserts that the goal of human life is to realize and manifest our divinity. Not only is this possible, it is inevitable. Our real nature is divine; God-realization is our birthright.
Finally, Vedanta affirms that all religions teach the same basic truths about God, the world, and our relationship to one another."

How To Succeed in Evil: The Original Podcast Episodes	"How to Succeed in Evil--Original Podcast Episodes are best thought of as notes and sketches for the novel length work How to Succeed in Evil:The Novel also available on podiobooks.com. 

This is not to take anything away from these episodes, the first 10 of which won a Parsec Award. 

Semi- Spoiler Alert: These episodes cover longer arc of story than the novel. Some of the stuff that happens in the podcasts might make it into a future novel. Then again, it might not. But then again, who cares. Shakespeare gave away the plot of most of his plays in the first 10 lines and it turned out okay for him."

Speech in the Silence: Thelema & Magick	"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. ~ In this podcast, we focus on the topics of Thelema, Aleister Crowley, and Ordo Templi Orientis while also touching upon the subjects of magick, yoga, and initiation. The podcast includes lectures, music, interviews, discussions, and readings of the Holy Books of Thelema and other important texts written by Aleister Crowley. Our mission is to spread awareness of the Law of Thelema, the writings of Aleister Crowley, and Ordo Templi Orientis. Speech in the Silence is also a creative outlet for Thelemites, and we encourage listener feedback and participation. ~ The Law of Thelema is revealed in Liber AL vel Legis, also known as The Book of the Law. This Law can be summarized in three verses from the Book: ""Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."" ~ ""Love is the law, love under will."" ~ ""There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt."" ~ Practitioners of Thelema are called Thelemites. Thelemites work towards the discovery and accomplishment of their True Will, the innermost nature of the individual. ~ The Law of Thelema grants us ultimate personal freedom, but also demands that we each use that freedom to do our True Will and nothing else. As it is written in The Book of the Law: ""... thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say nay."" ~ Respecting the divine and solar nature of every human being means that Thelemites mind their own business and do not interfere in the wills of others -- except in cases of tyranny and oppression. As the Book of the Law says ""Every man and every woman is a star."" ~ Aleister Crowley expands on this idea in his Extenuation: ""Every Star has its own Nature, which is 'Right' for it. We are not to be missionaries, with ideal standards of dress and morals, and such hard ideas. We are to do what we Will, and leave others to do what they Will. We are infinitely tolerant, save of intolerance."" ~ Aleister Crowley, also called The Master Therion and The Great Beast 666, is the Prophet of the Law of Thelema. In 1904 e.v., Crowley received the Book of the Law in a revelation while on honeymoon with his wife, Rose, in Cairo, Egypt. The reception of this Book trumpeted the beginning of the New Aeon of the Crowned and Conquering Child, where we can observe the decay of the idea of sin; the growth of innocence, self-confidence, and amorality; the increasing prevalence of bisexuality and androgyny; the childlike confidence in technological and cultural progress; and the acceptance of the individual as the fundamental unit of society. ~ Love is the law, love under will."

The Hilarious World of Depression	A show about clinical depression... with laughs? Well, yeah. Depression is an incredibly common and isolating disease experienced by millions, yet often stigmatized by society. The Hilarious World of Depression is a series of frank, moving, and, yes, funny conversations with top comedians who have dealt with this disease, hosted by veteran humorist and public radio host John Moe. Join guests such as Maria Bamford, Paul F. Tompkins, Andy Richter, and Jen Kirkman to learn how they've dealt with depression and managed to laugh along the way. If you have not met the disease personally, it's almost certain that someone you know has, whether it's a friend, family member, colleague, or neighbor. Depression is a vicious cycle of solitude and stigma that leaves people miserable and sometimes dead. Frankly, we’re not going to put up with that anymore. The Hilarious World of Depression is not medical treatment and should not be seen as a substitute for therapy or medication. But it is a chance to gain some insight, have a few laughs, and realize that people with depression are not alone and that together, we can all feel a bit better. The Hilarious World of Depression is made possible by a grant from HealthPartners’ and its Make It Okay campaign which works to reduce the stigma of mental health. www.makeitok.org

The Hacking UI Podcast	"The Hacking UI podcast is hosted by Sagi Shrieber and David Tintner, a designer and developer who are also both entrepreneurs, bloggers, productivity/time-hacking maniacs, and all around tech geeks.

The first season of the podcast is titled ‘Scaling a Design Team’, in which they speak with design leaders from top notch companies like Facebook, Apple, Invision, and Intercom, to discuss various team structures, responsibilities, and workflows.

A few months ago they quit their day jobs to work on their side project, Hacking UI, full time. So it was fitting that the second season of the podcast should touch on that subject. The second season is called ‘Scaling a Side Project’, and they interview creative entrepreneurs whom they admire, in order to learn about their paths to success and get them to share their tips and secrets."

Year of Polygamy Podcast	"The series follows the Mormon faith through the lens of “The Principle of Plural Marriage” from its genesis in 1831 with its originator Joseph Smith, through the hidden history and governmental pressure, to today and contemporary practicing Fundamentalist Mormons. 

For the first time polygamy is dissected through a feminist viewpoint, with attention given to the experiences of the women, women who sacrificed everything and suffered long and are never mentioned in museums or landmark tours. Their experiences, along with interviews with experts, sc20140302_130747holars, historians, and those still affected directly by the practice, paint a new portrait of how the west was shaped, by the hard work and toil of these invisible women, hidden away through controversy. 

Through Hansen’s careful work, we see how the practice of polygamy affected every aspect of the LDS church’s formation and is still a shadow hanging over the church, visible in it’s approach to marriage, the role of women, and the temple ceremonies. Instead of the historical footnote polygamy is often treated as, Hansen shows how this practice, started in secret and a direct cause of Joseph Smith’s death, responsible for driving the saints to Utah, and then outward again to Mexico and Canada, the root of power struggles both in the church and out, the cause of suspicion and eventually violence including the Mountain Meadows Massacre, was an instigator to most of the history of American West. For the first time, The Year of Polygamy shows how the west was settled not only to claim land and mineral rights, but in a very real way to control the bodies and sexuality of women in a way that reverberates today.

Yusha Evans	"He was born and raised in Greenville, South Carolina in a very conservative Christian home. In his early teens he became heavily involved in the church near his home and in Young Life, a non-denominational youth oriented organization with the intention of becoming involved in the ministry of teaching and preaching. He intended to enrol in Bob Jones University, a world-renowned Bible College in his hometown upon graduating high school, but in the summer of 1996 his life changed. Upon studying the bible from cover to cover and realizing many things were askew, and a lot of what he believed his entire life was not in line with what his research found, he left Christianity and went in search of the truth. After many twist and turns, ups and downs and after looking at the many world religions searching for the tangible proof of the right way of life he encountered a Muslim, and was given a Qur’an. After reading the Qur’an cover to cover he accepted Islam in the winter of 1998.



Yusha (Joshua) Evans Currently works as a full-time lecturer and caller to Islam, as well as teaching workshops that have taken him all across the globe. He is the founder and co-founder of two Islamic television stations in North America as well has appeared on many Islamic stations throughout the world. He has studied under numerous teachers and scholars in the various sciences of Islam and is a Psychology major. He is currently studying under Shaykh Waleed Al-Menesse, one of the world’s foremost Scholars in the Qur’an and its various sciences. He also is a multiple discipline Black belt holder."

The Positive Psychology Podcast - Bringing the Science of Happiness to your Earbuds with Kristen Truempy	The science of the good life, huh? Sorry this is not about booze, sex and rock n'roll (or whatever is en vogue right now).   In fact we talk about a lot of things that tree huggers would love: appreciation of beauty, gratitude, positive emotions, relationships and well, love. However we, that is positive psychologists and positive psychology practitioners buried ourselves in books, set out to experiment and then write it all up in a writing style that is about as exciting to read as watching an avocado turn brown. And that's the problem: if you are not an academic you probably want a little bit more excitement, than pages and pages of densely written journals can provide. Even if you are an academic, who has time to read all the interesting stuff out there anyways? So in an effort to save your eyes taking on a comically rectangular shape the positive psychology podcast brings the science of the good life to your earbuds. It's not all treehugger style though; sometimes we might get quite serious, for example when exploring things like post-traumatic growth or positive parenting. Subscribe if you want to benefit from the scientific insights into happiness and meaning while you are on the go. Let me know where you are while you are listening to this. If you like it review it, because that's the only way other people can find it too.

It's such an absorbing book, it's got diamond mines of references, it's so compassionate, so tender, so moving, so funny - and most of us never know that, because most of us have long been daunted by it. No need to be afraid any more - that is, if you make a habit of listening to these podcasts.

The Bubble Hour	"The Bubble Hour is hosted by Jean M., a sober woman dedicated to breaking down the walls of stigma and denial surrounding the disease of alcoholism.

Alcoholism effects more than 50% of American adults, either directly or indirectly, and yet it still remains a ""taboo"" topic and is still mostly misunderstood by the majority of people (even those effected by alcoholism and their loved ones).

The Bubble Hour seeks to inform, educate and help people identify with the stories they hear, the conversations and interviews with people who are just like they are, and let people know they aren't alone. Nobody can take the first tentative steps towards sobriety without first getting past denial, but even once they are past denial the stigma surrounding alcoholism is so strong that people are reluctant to seek help.

The Bubble Hour would like to change that stigma. Jean and the vibrant community of sober people who join her here, will be recording and offering this show for anyone to listen to for information, community, empathy and understanding.

We are so grateful for the sober people who came before us to help find this path; this is one way to give back.

Please help us spread the word about this website and the pod casts; you may be helping someone you know well but don't even know they have a problem.

Alcoholism thrives in the dark.  Together, we bring light.  And hope."

For us at EthicsTalk -- ""ethics"" is broad and encompasses things that affect a human being's flourishing.  To that end, students working with the Center discuss ethics-related topics such as academic integrity, intrinsic motivation, procrastination, and cultivating self-regulation and other powerful habits. Additionally, we discuss study and motivational strategies related to intimidating endeavors such as studying for the bar exam. We are also very interested in how technology can either promote or hinder flourishing and discuss ""media ecology"" issues including the thought of Walter Ong and the concept of ""digital virtue"". In addition to our student produced show, scholars, authors and practitioners (such as Michael Strong, Anya Kamenetz, Lindsay Hyde, Thomas Farrell and Dr. Jeffrey Wigand) discuss ethics related issues with the Center's Director. To learn more about the Center, visit us at http://ethics.cmich.edu and follow us on twitter at: http://www.twitter.com/ethicstalk.

Creative Photoshop with John Reuter	Photoshop artist and educator John Reuter has created this Photoshop podcast geared towards the fine art photographers and teachers who are beginning to embrace Photoshop as part of their personal work and teaching curriculum.

To John, Photoshop is as much a printmaking program as it is a photography program.  The emphasis is to encourage the viewers to explore their creative impulses through Photoshop technique and develop a more personal vision.  These episodes are generally longer than many Photoshop podcasts but the goal is to provide the equivalent of a classroom experience with a more thorough examination of the topics.  To see examples of the images John creates and the workshops he offers in Photoshop at the International Center of Photography, Maine Photographic Workshops, Palm Beach Photographic Centre and Santa Fe Workshops please visit www.johnreuter.com.

Cast On	Cast On began on Monday, 31 October, 2005, founded on nothing more than the desire to talk about knitting to people who get it. All the other stuff, about how memories, thoughts, hopes and dreams are knit into the fabric we create, and so become part of the fabric of our lives; about how life and knitting intertwine, and how sometimes you simply cannot tell where one part leaves off the other begins; about how the only thing wrong with the world today is that there is not enough knitting in it, all that came later, over time. Since 2005 the podcast has evolved to focus on finding inspiration in the ordinary, using it to kick start the process of making stuff, and finding ways to carve out the creative time and space that allows you to work your ass off on the projects that matter most to you. Like knitting a sweater. Or saving the world.

We don't do toxic, and we don't do nerdrage. Our views on geekdom are positive and optimistic, and we believe that the most important part of being a geek is the people you get to geek out with.

Tightly focused discussions on specific topics drive the show. Striving to illustrate that it is entirely possible to be mega-geeks and responsible adults, we want to be your friend and create and open and positive geek community for everyone.

We started this podcast because we really want there to be a safe, welcoming, positive geek community for everyone.  We want to talk about stuff we love, make friends, and most importantly, make sure that everyone feels appreciated and that there's a place for them. So whether your love is video games, comic books, movies, TV, fitness, computers and tech, or whatever else...come geek out with us. Let's be friends."

And how she embraces both the darkness and light, the success and the struggle – an inevitable part of growth and transformation. Through her story, we all find the courage to explore these parts of our own journey, too."

Gaby Dunn is anything but a financial expert. A self-described ""bridge-burning livewire,"" she's always viewed money as an endless existential crisis - and she has a sneaking suspicion you do, too. So much of our identity and self-worth is caught up in how much money we have (or don't have), how hard it is to get it, and even harder to keep it. Money makes us freak out, cry, and do wildly inappropriate things. So how come nobody ever talks about it? 

Join Gaby for conversations with comedians, artists, musicians, actors, her parents, a financial psychologist, her boyfriend, and many others about the ways that money makes us feel confused, hopeless, and terrified. This is a safe space to admit that you have no idea what you're doing either."

Life Of Caesar	"On the 19th August, 14 CE, 767 years after the founding of Rome, nearly exactly 2001 years ago, the first Emperor of Rome, Augustus, finally died, at 75 years of age. His great-uncle and adoptive father, Julius Caesar, the most brilliant and successful general in Rome’s history, had been assassinated aged 56 after being the dictator of Rome for only 5 years. Augustus, on the other hand, thrust into the limelight at age 18, with no military or political experience, ruled Rome either as one-third of a triumvirate or by himself for 58 years and died, probably of natural causes, while still in power. His reign laid the foundations of a regime that lasted, in one form or another, for nearly fifteen hundred years through the ultimate decline of the Western Roman Empire and until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. He was one of the most influential figures in all of Western history - and yet I bet most of you hardly know anything about him.



WELL - THIS IS HIS STORY.



It's a story that contains shipwrecks, human sacrifice, betrayal, hairbreadth escapes, unbridled sex, battles on land and at sea, ambushes, family scandals, and above all the unforgiving pursuit of absolute power.



Join veteran podcasters Ray Harris (The World War II Podcast) and Cameron Reilly (The Napoleon Bonaparte Podcast) as they go on a journey to discover the true story about Augustus Caesar.

The My Wife Quit Her Job Podcast	The MyWifeQuitHerJob podcast hopes to dispel the common myths associated with starting an online business.  Through a series of personal interviews, Steve reveals the inside stories of how successful entrepreneurs started their online businesses to improve their lifestyle without exposing themselves to a lot of risk.  All of the entrepreneurs featured on the show bootstrapped their businesses from the ground up and hustled their way to the top without risking their life savings, without sacrificing their relationships by working 100 hour weeks and without needing extensive technical knowledge.   Steve strongly believes that entrepreneurship should be about providing you with the freedom to do what you enjoy and spend more time with the people you love.  When Steve's wife became pregnant with their first child, he put these principles into practice by starting his own online store so his wife could quit her job and stay at home.  And in just one short year, his online business made over 100K in profit to supplant his wife's lost salary and has grown in the double and triple digits since.  Today, Steve teaches others how to start profitable ecommerce stores of their own and encourages others to give entrepreneurship a chance through his blog at MyWifeQuitHerJob.com.

Speaking Easy - A Cocktail Podcast	"Speaking Easy is a cocktail and home entertaining podcast with a twist. Co-hosts Alex Luboff and Jordan Wicker are both avid cocktail party hosts, often in the company of one another, and have had several people approach them separately to ask about sharing some of their accumulated knowledge on cocktails and entertaining.



The Speaking Easy Podcast aims to break down the cocktails, planning, and other details needed to throw a great party, whether it’s 4 people or 40.



Now that twist: we’re most definitely not professionals. Both podcast hosts hold “real” jobs, and outside of hosting in their homes, are not actual bartenders. Alex and Jordan are enthusiasts, and approach the show from that perspective. Speaking Easy is not trying to create a whole new cocktail revolution, but rather spread the word about how easy it is to master simple crowd-pleasing cocktails.



If you watch a lot of “how-to’s” out there, you may see a professional bartender recommending a $75, hard-to-find, obscure ingredient that, yes, might create a world-class drink. We, however, are more interested in crafting an always satisfying drink, night-after-night, for your friends and family. Leave the fancy work to the professionals, we’re just trying to keep the party going.



We don’t expect to teach you to be the best bartender in the world– we’re certainly not. We’re hoping, as we say at the end of each show, that you’ll come along as we all toast “to being a better drinker.”"

The Doctor Paradox	"The Doctor Paradox is about addressing why despite having incredibly meaningful jobs, doctors are increasingly unhappy in their work. 
Quite simply, it is a tragedy that we have allowed this to happen. That intensely passionate, dynamic and altruistic individuals have lost their core passions and found themselves adrift in the world of healthcare is unacceptable.
The Doctor Paradox focuses on 4 key issues:
1. The factors that explain why doctors are dissatisfied with the world of healthcare.
But more importantly…
2. The physicians that have rediscovered their passions and carved new paths, both within and outside of traditional healthcare.
3. The experts who offer insight on topics related to the challenges faced and the mechanisms to address them such as sleep deprivation, burnout, career advice and philosophical perspectives.
4. The strategies to rediscover your passion, find a new course and pursue what is required to find fulfillment.
A primary responsibility of physicians is to add value and meaning to our patients lives and that of our own.
To fulfill only one of these criteria is not enough. Without value and meaning in our own lives it is almost impossible to provide it to that of our patients.
As physicians, we hold a most privileged position. We intersect with our patients lives, often in their darkest hour, with them asking for our help. For physicians to sustainably provide that help, they must first and foremost help themselves. Not to do so will ultimately degrade one of the most sacred of relationships: that of the patient in need and the doctor who can tend to that need.
The Doctor Paradox also serves to explore a ‘New Medicine’ where the traditional model of what it means to be a doctor has changed. That the doctor of the future will still be adding immense value and meaning to patients lives but may be doing so in ways not conventionally pursued before. The physicians of the future will help patients across a spectrum of care, from face to face clinical encounters to designing and developing novel technologies that will significantly impact the lives of patients. For a ‘New Medicine’ we need a ‘New Doctor’.
The future of medicine is bright but unless we begin a major course correction, physicians drift toward ever increasing uncertainty.
As the famous saying goes:
“Things always get worse…. before they get worse”.
It is up to us as physicians to effect the changes we wish to see in our own lives and in doing so, ultimately that of our patients.
Things are getting worse, let’s make them better.
We are ‘standing on the shoulders of giants’, so it’s not that we ought to, it’s that we have to."

Earth Ancients	"Earth Ancients chronicles the growing (and often suppressed) evidence of known and unknown 
civilizations, their ruined cities, and artifacts developed from advanced science and technology. Erased 
from the pages of time, these cultures discovered and charted the heavens, developed medicine and 
unleashed advancements that parallel and, in many cases, surpass our own. Join us and discover our lost history.
Armed with the thousands of anomalous archeological discoveries which have not been covered by 
conventional science and the media, we can no longer deny our ancient cultural inheritance. Our written 
history is wrong and we’ve been led to believe that humanity is just a few hundred thousand years old. In 
fact, the Hindu Yugas advance the notion that Homo Sapiens are millions of years old, and have lived on 
planet Earth through a series of rebirths.
It’s now a fact that we are the survivors of a series of cataclysmic events that took place approximately 
12,000 to 14,000 years ago. Our ancestors may have been aware of these impending disasters and fled 
underground shelter, or survived in caves; others may have left the planet, but a huge number perished.      
Though Earth Ancients does explore some of the popular theories that ancient aliens have visited our

planet, our philosophy and research paradigm is decidedly Earth-centric, elevating the historical discourse
about human brilliance and ingenuity found in the archaeological evidence. For example, many of the lost
cultures were able to:

 Harness natural electromagnetic field and channel them to build pyramids and colossal buildings

 Power tools and machines to shape sculptures and cut water channels

 Execute superior scientific and technical abilities lost to modern society"

The Gently Mad: Life, Business & Entrepreneurship without the BS	"If you're looking for that inspirational kick-in-the-pants to help take your life and career to the next level... this ain't it. To be perfectly honest, I'm tired of all the ""inspirational"" BS that passes for entrepreneurial podcasts these days. You won't find any neurohacking, hyper-accelerated list growth techniques, or sleazy marketing strategies. What you WILL get are honest, meaningful conversations and discussions about things that matter. The struggle to find purpose and meaning in our life and work, how to deal with self-doubt, fears, insecurities and failure. All the stuff we face every day, but don't every talk about. Sure, there will be plenty of conversations about entrepreneurship, business, marketing, blogging, podcasting, audience building, content creation, etc. But the through-line that connects it all is true authenticity and honesty. No BS. No hype. No meaningless buzzwords designed to get you to waste your money on a useless product. Just raw, honest conversations about things that actually matter. If you like The Fizzle Show, The Tim Ferriss Show, Nathan Barry's podcast, Paul Jarvis' and Jason SurfrApp's Invisible Office Hours or the #AskGaryVee show (ok I'm out of names to drop), you’ll probably enjoy this one. You’re mileage may vary."

lux radio theatre	"Lux Radio Theatre   1934-1955

This was one of few sixty-minute broadcasts and was the most important dramatic show in radio. The 931 episodes broadcast were all based on popular films with the biggest stars of Hollywood playing the parts and during its heyday the audience was estimated as high as forty million.

The one-and-only Cecil B. DeMille was your host (1936-45) for a lavish production of what was to become a veritable film checklist of many of Hollywoods best films from the mid-30s right through the mid 50s. Every genre is included, from darkest noir crime dramas to historical epics to bubbly musicals and broad comedies. There are some titles that are less known today, and that makes them even more historical.

The stars of the movie are usually in the productions, although sometimes contracts or schedules meant that another star took the part. In some another star would be featured in one of the major roles. The productions were live, with full orchestra, and many Hollywood legends were unused to performing in public without the benefit of retakes. Needless to say, the performances in every show are singular.

The Lux Radio Theatre is a masterpiece in OTRs crown, and each show is a historical time capsule that takes us back to the glamour of the Golden Age of Hollywood."

The following story captures the spirit of my podcast.  

I awoke early, as I often did, just before sunrise to walk by the ocean's edge and greet the new day. As I moved through the misty dawn, I focused on a faint, far away motion. I saw a youth, bending and reaching and flailing arms, dancing on the beach, no doubt in celebration of the perfect day soon to begin.
  As I approached, I sadly realized that the youth was not dancing to the bay, but rather bending to sift through the debris left by the night's tide, stopping now and then to pick up a starfish and then standing, to heave it back into the sea. I asked the youth the purpose of the effort. ""The tide has washed the starfish onto the beach and they cannot return to the sea by themselves,"" the youth replied. ""When the sun rises, they will die, unless I throw them back to the sea.""
  As the youth explained, I surveyed the vast expanse of beach, stretching in both directions beyond my sight. Starfish littered the shore in numbers beyond calculation. The hopelessness of the youth's plan became clear to me and I countered, ""But there are more starfish on this beach than you can ever save before the sun is up. Surely you cannot expect to make a difference.""
  The youth paused briefly to consider my words, bent to pick up a starfish and threw it as far as possible. Turning to me he simply said, ""I made a difference to that one.""
  I left the boy and went home, deep in thought of what the boy had said. I returned to the beach and spent the rest of the day helping the boy throw starfish in to the sea.

The Lift, An Audio Drama	"The hall is dark and the overhead light flickers. Sounds echo, and there’s a creaking and clanging which gets louder as you stand there in the semi-dark.The elevator opens and you’re offered a ride.

A dark place whose original luster is now lost to time. The unlikely, old Victorian building sits overlooked by most on the edge of Pittsburgh. Originally built as a luxury residence for some of the city’s most well to do residents, it now serves a different purpose.

Within its dilapidated walls sits The Lift. Step inside and ride it to the floor chosen for your transformation.

Don’t be afraid, for Victoria, the mysterious girl who operates The Lift, waits to guide you. The nine story building calls only to those who are meant to find it. Choose well, or choose poorly, either will require great sacrifice. 

YOUR CHANGE IS COMING.

The Lift is an homage to great dramas of the past like Night Gallery and The Twilight Zone. The Lift is a 2016 PARSEC Award Finalist, featuring dramatic readings of stories written by multiple writers. The Lift is Narrated by Daniel Foytik and Cynthia Lowman with additional voice work by Amber Collins as the voice of Victoria Bigglesworth-Hayes."

My Life on the Swingset: Adventures in Swinging & Polyamory Podcast	"The podcast version of the audiobook My Life on the Swingset: Adventures in Swinging & Polyamory.



Starting with a first date with a couple of swingers, followed by working through social anxiety and shyness, recognizing the importance of touch in life, evolving feelings about love and expectations, having threesomes, orgies, and prostate orgasms, going through a divorce, and leveling up in life and sexuality.



For five years, Cooper S. Beckett has written for Life on the Swingset. The website was born out of the feeling that he’d learned enough in his whole year of swinging to tell other people how to live their non-monogamous lives. His hubris can be seen from space. Here he has collected personal essays, stories, erotica, and prescriptive “how-tos” into this memoir of his life on The Swingset.



He may be biased when it comes to swinging, polyamory, and other forms of ethical non-monogamy (in fact, he most certainly is) but he doesn’t sugar-coat it. He speaks honestly and earnestly about a unique way to live life, one that allows for sexual and loving growth and experimentation, a strong sense of community, and the ability to do what we all crave whether we know it or not: Be honest with ourselves and others about what we want sexually. And out of life."

Is this participation-trophy era of the impotent male the lines have become blurry. Listen, laugh, and learn about manhood with Jim Ramos and producer Dale Collver as The Man Card Podcast draws a clear line in the sand between males and men interviewing real men in the arena, living real life, in real time.

The Three Month Vacation Podcast: Online Small Business|Marketing  Strategy Plan| Sean D'Souza | Psychotactics	"Sean D'Souza made two vows when he started up Psychotactics back in 2002. The first was that he'd always get paid in advance and the second was that work wouldn't control his life. He decided to take three months off every year. But how do you take three months off, without affecting your business and profits? Do you buy into the myth of ""outsourcing everything and working just a few hours a week?"" Not really. Instead, you structure your business in a way that enables you to work hard and then take three months off every single year. And Sean walks his talk. Since 2004, he's taken three months off every year (except in 2005, when there was a medical emergency). This podcast isn't about the easy life. It's not some magic trick about working less. Instead with this podcast you learn how to really enjoy your work, enjoy your vacation time and yes, get paid in advance."

AM/FM BY CHRIS LIEBING	Welcome to am/fm by Chris Liebing. This show is all about the music in the moment it was played. It kind of functions like an audible dj diary. The idea behind it is that I choose a recent set that I played and deliver it to you unedited, raw and direct, in 60 minutes pieces on a weekly basis. For example, if I play a three hours set somewhere, it will be divided in three 60 minutes long am/fm shows, so after three weeks you will have the full set. You could even put them into a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. I try to keep the commentaries to a minimum, so that you get a maximum amount of music. Still, I want to mention certain things during the show, but beyond that, I will provide additional info in form of a written set report, which can be found on www.chrisliebing.com or on my facebook-site.

Common Sense with Dan Carlin	"Common Sense with Dan Carlin is an independent look at politics and current events from popular New Media personality Dan Carlin.

Carlin's self-described ""Martian"" viewpoints infuse each episode with a political alien's take on the world around us and the problems it faces. It's a smart, unique (and admittedly U.S.-centric) program that doesn't dumb down the information or analysis for the slowest person in the room.

Carlin's rapid-fire staccato voice has been compared to William Shatner after too many espressos. That, plus his penchant for making everyone in the audience mad at him eventually, makes for a witch's brew of a podcast that is not for everyone. But for those craving a deeper intellectual analysis, a less partisan approach and unpredictable outside-the-box revelations, Common Sense with Dan Carlin is a feast for the mind."

Know The Cause Podcast	"Doug Kaufmann, the host of the popular TV show, Know The Cause, he became interested in the subject of fungus as it pertains to disease while working in the area of food allergy.

Doug was a U.S. Navy Medical Corpsman attached to the 7th Marine Division in 1970. Upon coming home from Vietnam in 1971, he had strange symptoms that until the early 1980’s, he thought were related to food allergies.  A research paper in 1980 entitled “Antigenically Intact Food Macromolecules Exiting The Gut Lumen” offered insight into the role of the terrain of the intestines in food allergies.  As long as the intestines leaked, which is not uncommon, food allergies tend to change as the diet changed.  After studying the reason that foods were able to leak through the intestines, Doug saw the role of fungus in provoking both symptoms and diseases.  As it turned out, whether it was yeast in alcoholic beverages,  mold by-products of medications like commonly taken antibiotics, or mere fungi like mushrooms,  a link to illness, unknown to physicians, became apparent."

Recorded in Los Angeles, we speak with post-mormons, ex-mormons, jacked-mormons, and active mormons alike about their parents' timid explanations of where babies come from, awkward bishop interviews that mostly focus on masturbation, first sexual experiences, current outlook on sex, and more.

Alcohol Mastery Podcast	"Kevin O'Hara from Alcohol Mastery reveals all his strategies and techniques for helping you to quit drinking permanently.  

Alcohol Mastery is structured around the belief that Heavy drinking is just a habit that has simply gotten out of control.  It’s a habit that 80% of the population has been brainwashed into believing is the norm.  And, it’s a habit that is very simple to quit… you simply stop drinking.  

Alcohol Mastery focuses on the immense gains you get when you move away from alcohol,  rather than dwelling on the loss of the precious poison.  It’s about stepping away from the alcoholic label, perpetuating the AA type ‘alcoholic forever’ mentality, and blaming the alcohol instead of the drinker.

Alcohol Mastery is about guiding you onwards, toward your new life of freedom, control, and self respect. 

Some of the topics covered include frequently asked questions about common problems you might encounter when you quit drinking, general quitting alcohol tips and advice, and regular updates about my stop drinking alcohol journey. 

There are new episodes being posted all the time, so make sure you come back regularly.

Onwards and upwards!"

Those Conspiracy Guys	"Those Conspiracy Guys is a weekly podcast where we discuss all types and genres of conspiracy theories, paranormal happenings and true crime from Atlantean myths to Zapruder films; from ghosts and demons to alien abductions; from werewolves and vampires to CIA assassins and Russian spies. We have a big episode every two weeks, a True Crime show every other week and loads of other stuff every so often and you can head over to the website for details.

Our aim is to cast a light into the dark corners of corruption, conspiracy and suppression. We want to scour a web laden with tales of political intrigue, extra-terrestrials, rogue governments, secret societies, the paranormal, murder, mayhem, deceit, destruction, the cryptozoological and the psycho-pharmacological and present the fable of the 21st century: The Conspiracy Theory.

It's a Podcast that asks the unanswered questions of the wildest mysteries and weirdest truths from throughout our history. Taking universally available information from all around the internet and beyond, we'll provide a funny and friendly resource for all your conspiracy needs.

With weekly Podcast episodes and our constantly updated website Those Conspiracy Guys want to bring some truth to your inquisitive ears.

No topic is too delicate or outlandish and we want to make it palatable for everyone from beginners to experts. From the average guy on the street to a die hard conspiracy nut, we want to bring you the great conspiracies of time immemorial to the ones unfolding around us everyday. We avoid the tinfoil hats and poorly crafted sci-fi stories that litter the internet, to bring you conspiracies that you have heard about and more that you haven’t. 

We are gleaning information from a seemingly insurmountable wall of waffle and running our common sense detector over some of the misinformation that lies in the stagnant swamp of the web.

We are but 'humble' Irish people, with a propensity for critical thinking and common sense, and a host of friends with the same mindset, but we all have a third eye squinted open for the strangeness of truth and are all tireless in the never ending quest for the opportunity to have the craic.

Have you ever watched the news and thought ‘that doesn’t look right?’.

Have you ever questioned main stream media or questioned what ‘main stream’ even means?

Have you ever agonised over the official version of events that seemed like they were the script of a bad movie?

Then this is the podcast for you. We analyse easily available material and cast a critical eye over it; discussing the validity of its sources and its credibility as fact. Sometimes we believe it, sometimes we don’t, but you can make your own mind up because we are just a bunch of people with some free time and questionable search histories. 

You can support our show by visiting www.patreon.com/thoseconspiracyguys and donating. You will get access to awesome exclusive content and be able to interact with us like you're the favourite in the family!"

Unraveling the Secrets	"Welcome to ""Unraveling the Secrets.""  My name is Dennis Crenshaw.  My co-host is Rick ""Oz"" Osmon. For the past 45 years we have been researching the connecting links between all things having to do with the secrets and pernicious deeds of a group of secret society outlaws who are working together behind the scenes to create a completely controlled world society with them as bosses and you and I as slaves to their system. This continuing scheme is popularly known as the New World Order, or the NWO.  

Our research actually began with the search for the origin of the so-called UFOs.  My starting point in the mid-60s was the fact that they are real, nuts and bolts craft controlled by advanced civilizations with bases here on earth. The fact that these advanced technological aircraft exists as solid metallic flying machines is based on my personal up-close observation of one.  My early research indicates that MOST of the unexplained airships we see in our skies are from somewhere ON or INSIDE our planet.  This led to my research of the Hollow Earth/ Subterranean Theories in the 1980s-90s which led to my realization that the answers I seek are in the control of a number of elitist groups and secret societies that I call collectively the Controllers.  And as even a quick look at recent worldwide events should convince anyone who is paying attention the Controllers plan is working very well, thank you.  Sometime around 14 years ago I was joined in my research by our co-host, the OZ.  

It is these things and more that we will explore on this radio show.  Join us as we work towards . . . Unraveling the Secrets."

Through this process, anyone can learn to trace unhappiness to its source and deal with it there.

Trucking with Authority	Show Description Trucking with Authority could just as well be called Motor Carrier 101: An introduction to becoming a motor carrier with your own authority. We explore the ins and outs of becoming a motor carrier, covering a wide range of topics such as: how to apply and deal with the FMCSA; record keeping; compliance; sales and marketing; working with brokers; and building relationships with direct customers. We explore thought-provoking concepts that address how to set yourself apart from the crowd and how to succeed on your own. Bio Kenny’s interest in the trucking industry began early. He was about 10 when his dad first let him drive a truck, and soon afterward he was eagerly helping to work on them as well. At 18, he started driving legally, working at his dad’s excavating company in Michigan. It was there that he cut his teeth pulling heavy haul doubles, end dump, and RGN. Kenny moved to Florida in 2006 and bought his own OTR tractor. He leased on to a few percentage-pay carriers before finding a home at Landstar. He had a terrific experience there, and would probably still be leased on to Landstar today if it weren’t for his military obligations: the US Army requested that he deploy to Kuwait and Iraq in 2011. Kenny proudly served alongside his brothers and sisters, operating flatbeds and heavy equipment trucks in areas where an improperly-secured load posed a risk much greater than just an OOS violation. When Kenny returned home in 2012, he decided to get his own authority, along with a plan of teaching his wife Elizabeth to drive his truck. Although she’d never even been inside a truck, Elizabeth was a quick study. They’ve been operating as a team ever since, and enjoy exploring and absorbing the sights of our beautiful nation together. Over the 17 years that he’s officially worked in the trucking industry, Kenny has always considered himself to be self-employed. From driving at a young age and learning how to work on his own truck, to negot

You’ll come away with successful strategies for building your own house, with or without a general contractor.  

Become an educated consumer, even if you prefer to buy, rather than build a new house. Complex construction jargon and best practices will be explained in easy to understand terms.  It’s not the typical DIY (do it yourself) show.  You will learn how to MANAGE the labor, not DO the labor for your new house.

Join me, Michelle Nelson, host and fellow informal residential construction student.  I’ll share the research I find on home design and building as I prepare to build my home. Together, our community of future home builders, will learn the tips, tricks and trends of experienced contractors and industry experts. 

I’ll interview owner-builders and construction professionals.  During our mini lessons, I’ll inform you about framing, flooring, windows, insulation, kitchen cabinets and countertops…almost anything having to do with new construction homes.  You’ll hear about energy efficiency and green building too.  There will be product reviews in which you will be introduced to cutting edge, as well as, tried and true products and services.  And in keeping with the university theme, episodes will end with short, fun quizzes. 

If we do our due diligence BEFORE we start construction, we will actually start construction with the most difficult part of the project behind us.  Let’s put in the time, effort, preparation and research BEFORE we break ground and building our homes will be much easier and more enjoyable."

Bhagavad Gita Discourses	"The Song Celestial unfolds a dialogue of the advice given by an avatar or God incarnate. The recipient of the message is Arjuna, the prototype of the struggling human soul who is ready to receive the great knowledge by his close companionship and increasing nearness to the divine Self within himself. 
This symbolic companionship of Krishna and Arjuna, the divine and the human soul is further dramatized by the fact that their dialogue takes place amidst the din and clamor of a battlefield. The teacher in the Gita is therefore not only the God who is transcendent but also the God in man who unveils Himself through an increasing knowledge... 
                                                                     Vanamali, Nitya Yoga.  
Aldous Huxley, asserts that ‘The Bhagavad Gita occupies an intermediate position between scripture and theology; for it combines the poetical qualities of the first with the clear-cut methodicalness of the second. ‘The book may be described’ writes Ananda K. Coomaraswamy in his admirable Hinduism and Buddhism, ‘as a compendium of the whole doctrine to be found in the earlier Vedas, Brahmanas and Upanishads, and being therefore the basis of all the The later developments, it can be regarded as the focus of all Indian religion...
...But this focus of Indian religion is also one of the clearest and most comprehensive summaries of the perennial philosophy ever to have been made. Hence its enduring value, not only for Indians, but for all mankind’.
The Bhagavad Gita (Song Celestial) offers an understanding of The Great Mystery, which has inspired many of the giants of the Western intellectual tradition. The transcendentalist poets Emerson, Thoreau, and Whitman were students of The Bhagavad Gita. Thoreau wrote: ‘In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous cosmological philosophy of The Bhagavad Gita, in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial.’
Emerson, referring to the Gita, wrote: ‘It was the first of books. It was as if an empire spoke to us, nothing small or unworthy, but large, serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence which in another age . . . had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which exercise us.’
This is a series of discourses on the liberating teachings of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Song Celestial) by Mataji (Mother) Vanamali, Vanamali Gita Yogasram, Rishikesh, North India.
Vanamali Mataji is the author of The Lila Hindu World Heritage Library. Her books include: a translation of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Nitya Yoga, a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita,  Sri Krishna Lila, Sri Rama Lila, Sri Shiva Lila, Sri Devi Lila, Sri Hanuman Lila, Lilas of the Sons of Shiva, Gurudeva  and The Taste Divine. Sri Devi Lila is published in the U.S. as  Shakti: Realm of The Divine Mother , Sri Hanuman Lila  as  Hanuman: The Devotion and Power of The Monkey God.
Each talk is introduced with the Sanskrit invocations and chanting of the Gita chapter. Then Mataji Vanamali offers a line-by-line illumination of Shri Krishna's liberating teachings.

The truth is, we share a lot of common interests, but we each have our own specific favorites and specialties. That's probably why we have so much fun when we get together. We use the recording sessions to catch up with each other, get things off our chests, and throw around a few light-hearted insults. We start each episode with a short list of topics we plan to cover, but you never know where the conversation will go.
The Internet of Things Podcast - IoT	"Stacey Higginbotham has covered technology since 2001. In my years covering tech I became more fascinated by the stuff were were able to do on vast computing networks and ever speedier mobile and wireline broadband networks. Finally all of the elements of the technology I’ve covered in more than a decade have culminated in this moment and we’re creating the internet of things.



No matter what you call it, we’re at a pivotal moment in the evolution of human creativity, business creation and productivity gains. We could see the gains we make in these next few years help us conserve resources and let us lead safer and healthier lives or we could open the door to a dystopian society where our every thought is monitored and our every utterance is effectively for sale. I hope to explore all of these issues, the people who will make it possible and the devices that will lead us there in the IoT Podcast. I hope you will join me."

Bilal Philips	"Dr. Abu Ameenah Bilal Philips was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and grew up in Toronto, where he converted to Islam in 1972. His whole life has been exemplified by his goal of seeking and conveying Islamic knowledge in order to “Change the Muslim Nation through Islamic Education.”



In preparation for this goal, he first acquired a B.A. from the College of Islamic Disciplines at the Islamic University of Medina (1979), then an M.A. in aqeedah (Islamic Theology) from King Saud University in Riyadh (1985), and finally a PhD in Islamic Theology from the University of Wales (1994). Interestingly enough, His PhD thesis was on ""The Exorcist Tradition in Islam"".



After graduation from the University of Medina, Dr Bilal spent ten years teaching Islamic studies in an Islamic high school in Riyadh, and another ten years lecturing in Arabic and Islamic studies in the American University in Dubai, UAE.



In 1994 he founded the first Islamic Information Center in Dubai. He has served as the head of the Department of Arabic and Islamic Studies at Preston University-Ajman, UAE; lecturer and director of the Da'wah and Education at Qatar Guest Center, Doha, Qatar; founder and head of the English medium Islamic studies department of Knowledge International University, Riyadh; founder and head of the College of Da'wah and Islamic Culture (English Section) at Omdurman Islamic University, Sudan; founder and head of Preston International University College in Chennai, India; and founder and Dean of the Islamic Studies Academy in Doha, Qatar.



But perhaps his greatest achievement, and the one for which he was listed in the Jordanian publication, 'The 500 Most Influential Muslims', is the historic founding of the Islamic Online University which in only 5 years has over 80,000 students registered from every country on the face of this earth! Unlike the other educational programs he has founded and overseen over the years, IOU makes it possible for any person from any location in the world to receive an Islamic education absolutely free."
The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells	"Extraterrestrial invasion, the earth taken over by omniscient intelligences from Mars, the whole of humanity under siege and a nameless narrator who seems to be the lone survivor of the complete devastation of human civilization – scenes from a Hollywood sci-fi blockbuster? Far from it! The War of the Worlds by HG Wells was written more than a century ago and went on to become an iconic work in the science fiction genre, spawning a whole new genre of literature featuring alien invaders. It was in fact the first book to present the idea of conflict between inhabitants of different planets. 

The story begins in an observatory in Ottershaw, when scientists note a series of mysterious explosions taking place on Mars. Some days later, the narrator who is on a walk on the Surrey Downs notices a weird cylindrical vehicle that suddenly opens to release a horde of hideous creatures who are later discovered to be Martians. The creatures are unable to breathe Earth's air and swiftly return to their vehicle. A peace delegation of humans tries to make contact but they're ruthlessly scorched to death by Martian heat-ray weapons. Thus begins the War of the Worlds. The British military swings into action, but their arms and ammunition are defenseless against sophisticated chemical weapons and heat-rays. 

Events race towards calamity as the nations of the earth unite to combat these fearful invaders to no avail. Survivors are reduced to scavenging for food with the cities of the world reduced to mere rubble. Can the human race survive? Will the narrator and his family escape destruction? 

The author, HG Wells was a science teacher in a small village in Somerset, England. However, he was also a gifted writer who wrote in several genres – science fiction, literary novels, short stories, history, politics and social sciences. A keen student of war and combat, he created a set of rules for playing war games with toy soldiers, which provides an interesting glimpse of logistics, strategy and close combat techniques. Wells' contribution to our ideas of science fiction remains unparalleled and the book has been widely filmed, staged and televised. The War of the Worlds was immortalized as a Halloween prank in a radio show that aired on CBS on October 30, 1938, causing widespread panic and chaos as listeners across the United States tuned in and began fleeing from their homes! 

The enduring appeal of this book makes it a must read classic for readers of all ages."

Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome by E.M. Berens	"Silver footed, fair haired Thetis, Ares the God of War, Nike the Goddess of Victory, The Furies and The Muses, Zeus the presiding deity of the Universe and the magical, mysterious Olympus, are some of the amazing, mythical Greek and Roman deities you'll encounter in this book. 

Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome by EM Berens was originally intended for young readers. Written in an easy and light style, the author attempts to bring the pantheon of gods into a comprehensible format. He organizes them into different dynasties and chronologies to make it easier for the reader to understand the labyrinthine relationships and connections between the various gods, heroes, minor divinities, mythical figures and legendary creatures. 

Greek and Roman legends form the base of all European art, literature and civilization itself. Since the advent of Christianity, the so called Pagan religion which dominated all of Europe for thousands of years were eclipsed but the study of the Classics as part of the education in Greek and Latin kept them alive. Today there's hardly a serious student of English or art who does not encounter some reference to an ancient Greek or Roman myth or deity somewhere in literature and the Western languages. A visit to any of the museums or classical art galleries in Europe would be one that's filled with allusions and depictions of Greek or Roman legends. 

For modern day readers, the book is a mine of information about the lineage of the gods, forms of worship, festivals and temples devoted to them. It is interestingly chronicled, right from the primordial legend of Uranus and Gaia to the Creation of the Earth, through the dynasties of the Gods, heroes and divinities of the Night and the Sea, right up to the Trojan War where the Gods played a most important role in the destiny of humans. The section on temples and worship is especially interesting for students of archeology and history. It also includes statues, augurs, soothsayers, temple architecture, altars, priests and sacrifices. 

The extensive footnotes and author's notes for each chapter add value and interest while the charming illustrations make it attractive for younger readers. Anyone who is interested in exploring the ancient legends of two of the oldest Western civilizations would certainly find Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome by E.M. Berens a source of hours of reading pleasure and a valuable addition to their bookshelf."

Paradise Lost by John Milton	"Magnificent in its scale and scope, this monumental poem by the blind poet John Milton was the first epic conceived in the English language. It describes an omniscient, all powerful God, the Fall of Man, the Temptation in the Garden of Eden, the disgraced angel who later becomes known as Satan, the Angelic Wars fought by Archangels Michael and Raphael and the Son of God who is the real hero of this saga. 

The poet John Milton was more than sixty years old when he embarked on this immense work of literary creation. His father was a wealthy merchant who had embraced Protestantism despite opposition from his Catholic family. Milton grew up in a privileged environment, having been schooled at home by private tutors and traveling extensively throughout Italy. It was here that he first read Virgil and Homer and decided to create his own epic in English. 

Tumultuous historical events intervened, like the English Civil War and the establishment of Puritan Rule. Milton was deeply embroiled in politics and the new parliament. When the monarchy was restored, Milton found himself on the wrong side and he retreated into hiding where he began working on his dream of creating an epic to match the best in Latin and Greek. He completed it after five years of tremendous effort, since he was already totally blind when he began working. The entire work, consisting of nearly ten thousand individual lines of blank verse was dictated by Milton from memory, to a series of scribes. 

Paradise Lost consists of twelve smaller volumes divided into Books. Each one is devoted to a particular Biblical episode. It begins with a prologue that describes the subject of the epic, much like an introduction. The action shifts to the rebellion of Lucifer and from then on, to familiar episodes like the temptation of Adam and Eve and their disobedience to God's laws. Satan and his unholy legions are described in great detail as are their rebellion and malevolence. Adam and Eve, God and the Son of God are portrayed in brilliant, unforgettable lines and the conflict between the forces of good and evil is represented on a cosmic scale. 

For lovers of poetry and literature, Paradise Lost represents a seminal work of supreme importance in English literature. Present-day readers will certainly find it fascinating to decode the multitude of classical references, Biblical lore, social and cultural themes that adorn this great work."

Dragnet	Dragnet was created and produced by Jack Webb, who starred as the terse Sgt. Friday. Webb had starred in a few mostly short-lived radio programs, but Dragnet would make him one of the major media personalities of his era.Webb was a stickler for accurate details, and Dragnet used many authentic touches, such as the LAPD's actual radio call sign (KMA-367), and the names of many real department officials, such as Ray Pinker and Lee Jones of the crime lab or Chief of Detectives Thad Brown. Dragnet was perhaps the most famous and influential police procedural drama in American media history. The series gave millions of Americans a feel for the boredom and drudgery, as well as the danger and heroism, of real-life police work. Dragnet earned praise for improving the public opinion of police officers. Actor and producer Jack Webbâs aims in Dragnet were for realism and unpretentious acting. He achieved both goals, and Dragnet remains a key influence on subsequent police dramas in many media. The shows cultural impact is demonstrated by the fact that even after five decades, elements of Dragnet are known to those who've never seen or heard the program.

Tajweed in English and French	"These podcasts are designed specifically for English speakers who want to learn tajweed. It will also assist those who do not have the chance to meet a sheikh or qari in their local area, by assisting them to seek this sacred knowledge of Quran and tajweed.

Given that there are approximately 20 million Muslims in the English speaking world, this is a useful resource to bring this sacred knowledge to those who cannot find access to sheikhs.

The podcasts are a series of short, engaging lectures, going through the rules of Arabic alphabet, makharij (articulation points), sifaat (qualities of letters), waqf (rule stopping and pausing) rasm (Orthography relating to recitation of certain words).

There will also be some elaboration on the meaning of tajweed, the history of it (including the biography of Imam Hafs and â€˜Asim) and finally, a brief summary on the work of Imam Al-Jazari and ImamAl-Shatibirhm. This interesting historical background provides English speakers with some context of the great Islamic scholarship that is the basis of how and why we study tajweed today."

Missing Maura Murray	"""Missing Maura Murray"" is a true crime podcast about the mysterious disappearance of Maura Murray. Maura was a 21 year old college student in February of 2004 when she inexplicably drove three hours from her dorm in Amherst, Massachusetts to the White Mountains of New Hampshire and vanished. At approximately 7:30pm her car was involved in a single car, non life threatening accident at a hairpin turn on the dark and desolate Route 112. The few witnesses who spoke with police said she denied their assistance. She was gone without a trace before the police showed up approximately ten minutes later. She has never been seen or heard from since. Now two filmmakers set out to make a documentary and find answers on this mystery by diving deep into Maura's life, the region in which she went missing, and the online world of armchair detectives. Hosted by Tim Pilleri and Lance Reenstierna. If you have any information on Maura's location please contact the New Hampshire State Police. MauraMurrayDoc.com MissingMauraMurray@gmail.com"

Mundaka Upanishad	"Upanishads predominantly occur in the last portion of the Vedas and are therefore, also referred to as, Vedanta.  The central theme of all the Upanishads is the same, viz., the underlying oneness of Beings and the Lord.  Further, the Upanishads also reveal to us - the qualifications that a student needs to have in order to receive this knowledge; the qualifications essential for a teacher imparting this knowledge; the nature of Liberation; how the world is apparent in nature; and so on.  Each Upanishad explains these in its own unique way. Upanishads, thus, form the philosophical portion of the Vedas.  They are, in general, in the form of a dialogue between a teacher and a student.
            
            One may begin the study of the Upanishads from the Mundaka Upanishad as it is in this Upanishad that the teachings are given in a systematic manner.
            
            Accompanying text for Mundaka Upanishad is available for download.
            
            The entire collection of Swamiji's talks is available at the Poornalayam website."

Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy	"Losing Weight is as easy as 1,2,3,4 

In order to lose weight you have to do four things. Most people focus only on one or two things, that's why they fail. Most people focus on either 1) eating right or 2) exercising more.

While those two things are the nuts and bolts to losing weight. There are two other elements that are just as important and without implementing them you are destined to fail. In order to successfully lose weight and keep it off you also must have 3) a support sytem and 4) an accountability system in place.

We discovered the importance of support and accountability during the time we owned a personal training studio. Our clients were able to stay compliant with their eating and exercise programs as long as a trainer was there to support them and keep them accountable. If a client ever left, they inevitably had a difficult time staying compliant and eventually gained the weight they had struggled so desperately to lose right back.

In order to make personal training (which is typically very expensive) more accessible to everyone we developed the Partner Power Weight Loss Program. Partner Power teaches you some of the pyschological dynamics that help trainers support their clients and keep them accountable. Obviously a partner is not a fitness trainer, but they can serve some if not most of the roles a trainer serves in the areas of support and accountability.

Now he writes at Getbusylivingblog.com where he helps others get unstuck in life and start living again. He currently runs a lifestyle business focused on selling t-shirts online. His previous business he developed iPhone and iPad apps. His first app, Photo 365, was released in August 2011 and three weeks later was featured as Apple's App of the Week worldwide.

Flipping Houses for Rookies	"Discover the secret methods I'm using to earn massive piles of cash By “flipping houses” without using my own money or credit! This method works in ANY economy, in any geographic location, and can be done by anyone, regardless of their credit or finances. 
Is it possible to earn a six-figure income on a part time schedule? Find out what my students and I are doing without using our own money or credit to flip real estate!

If you are looking to increase your income, or just simply take in huge extra chunks of cash, without working 80 hours per week, you are in the right place.

What you will discover here and nowhere else on the Internet is a systematic and simple training system that anyone can implement to make money investing in real estate. I make it easy for you to learn and will even let you look over-my-shoulder, as I show you the steps to start flipping houses successfully.

Just imagine yourself as a successful real estate investor: flipping houses, paying off chucks of debt, putting your kids through college while quickly building a retirement nest egg, and still having time to travel because you’re living life on your own terms.
You might be thinking this is all B.S. – just another make money scheme. But if you pass on this information and miss this opportunity, you’ll most likely be stuck working a job, with little or no hope of getting ahead, or getting out of debt, never having the chance to put the kids through college, or adequately fund your retirement account.

Ask me how I know all of this . . . been there done that! But I learned how to get out of that rut and have the lifestyle most people only dream about."

Accounting Instruction, Help, & How To - Bob Steele	"Goal: One stop location to find accounting information, help, and training. Differentiation – 1) Large comprehensive selection of topics including financial accounting, managerial accounting, tax, and small business tips. 2) Use of trial balance and chart of accounts including an explanation to understand more concepts as they relate to the accounting process as a whole, including the double entry accounting system, the chart of accounts, and debits and credits. Many books and resources focus on very limited aspects of a topic leaving us with little understanding of how it fits into the double entry accounting system, how it relates to debits and credits, and how it would be journalized to a trial balance. We make an effort to show these accounting relationships. 

Learning Philosophy – Accounting is learned best by doing. Much of accounting should be learned with the use of electronic spreadsheets such as Excel or Google Sheets. Learning accounting is also the best way to learn how to use electronic spreadsheets. These are not 2 separate activities to be learned in isolation from each other, but rather they should be learned at the same time, so open up Excel or sign up to a free Google Sheets account and let’s work some problems.

Objectives:

• Provide learning resources to any user including accounting students, users who work in an accounting department or firm, or anybody who wants to learn more about accounting, and or, Excel

• Allow users to locate what they need in a quick and easy way

• Provide example problems which break down concepts into learnable parts

• Provide example problems that explain the use of electronic spreadsheets like Excel so that users can learn how to use these applications within a practical context

• Provide lectures that discuss accounting topics

• Provide reading material to explain accounting topics"

The Spanish Dude Podcast (Audio)	If you’ve always wanted to learn Spanish, but didn’t think it was possible because you were terrible at Spanish in high school, or you don’t get sucked into Rosetta Stone-style hype–you’ve come to the right place.  I’m a normal person, not some big company and not some native Spanish speaker. I’m not a natural language learner at all actually. My first brush with Spanish ended with me getting an F in high school!  But somewhere along the way, I fell in love! I’m not sure if I love Spanish because I love traveling, or I love traveling because I love Spanish (and food). But I love them both.  Naturally, I want more people to love what I love, but I know that you probably don’t see Spanish like I do… not yet! That’s the point of this podcast.  I want to show you that there is ANOTHER WAY! That most of the strategies and tactics they used to teach us Spanish in high school are IGNORANT.  They are ignorant to our plight.   I know your mistakes. I understand why you make them. They were my mistakes too!  I remember the pain and the agony of having to figure it all out myself because... let’s just say... I was underwhelmed with the resources out there.  Well, now with these videos (or audios) you don’t don’t have to waste the years I did.

Gunsmoke - OTRWesterns.com	Gunsmoke was a long-running old-time radio and television Western drama program set in Dodge City, Kansas during the settlement of the American West. The radio show first aired on April 26, 1952 and ran until June 18, 1961 on the CBS radio network. The series starred William Conrad as Marshal Matt Dillon, Howard McNear as Doc Charles Adams, Georgia Ellis as Kitty Russell, and Parley Baer as Deputy Chester Proudfoot. Doc’s first name and Chester’s last name were changed for the television program. Gunsmoke was notable for its critically acclaimed cast and writing, and is commonly regarded as one of the finest old time radio shows. Some listeners have argued that the radio version of Gunsmoke was far more realistic than the television program. Episodes were aimed at adults, and featured some of the most explicit content of the day: there were violent crimes and scalpings, massacres and opium addicts. Miss Kitty’s occupation as a prostitute was made far more obvious on the radio version than on television. Many episodes ended on a down-note, and villains often got away with their crimes.

We believe that Buddhist teachings have much to offer, not only to those who self-identify as Buddhist, but more fundamentally to all who seek to live intentional, compassionate, and balanced lives. And we believe that we can do this best when we have a community that is welcoming open and supportive.  ***   
Introductory topics include: meditation, mindfulness, stress reduction, Tibetan Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism   ***   
Advanced topics include: Vajrayana, the Drikung Kagyu tradition, Chod, Milarepa, Tara, and more.    ***

Because Dr. Footnick teaches the Torah in manner that makes it accessable for all (Jews, Christians, atheist, and anyone), he was asked to record his sessions for references and for those unable to attend.  Now those recordings are available to all as a FREE podcast.  So, if you have ever had an interest in: God, Torah (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy), the Bible, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Atheism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hebrew, Sumer, Philosophy, Psychology, NLP, Hypnosis, Egyptology, Archeology, Science, Miracles, Aliens, Angels, Despotism, Communism, Liberty, Americanism, Israel, Ethics, Morality, Holiness, Goodness, Evil, Free Will, and much, MUCH more then you will enjoy Torah Means Teacher as all these areas are frequently discussed in one manner or another.  Nahum utilizes commentary from many sources.

Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast – Learn about blockchain and fintech	"Interviews with the top people in the Bitcoin world about blockchain and fintech. Your host is Trace Mayer, J.D. recommended Bitcoin around a nickel and has invested in key infrastructure such as (1) Armory - the most secure Bitcoin wallet, (2) Bitpay - the largest Bitcoin merchant processor, (3) Bitmain - the largest and most profitable Bitcoin mining company and (4) Kraken - the largest Euro and best Bitcoin exchange. He has helped many people profit by demonstrating a significant documented foresight and prognostication ability in the money, currency and payment markets and developments.



Gold, Bitcoin, blockchain, silver, finance and economics. Monetary science applied to current events. This wrapup will teach you about sound money and cutting edge technologies to help you protect, preserve and grow your wealth during The Great Credit Contraction holders of capital are increasingly seeking safety and liquidity.



Mr. Mayer has degrees in accounting and law and has studied the Austrian school of economics. He has authored several books and speaks internationally at investment conferences.



Gold has been the penultimate safe haven throughout millennia and will remain the Ancient Metal of Kings. But the new decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant blockchain technology, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has set a new standard for liquidity. Bitcoin allow users to send any amount of money to any other person instantly without a fee to anywhere in the world without any restrictions whatsoever.



Because bitcoins are a sterile asset, like gold, any rise in price functions as a wealth transfer from other assets in the economy to holders of bitcoins on the blockchain.



For the past decade the fiat currency collapse has continued unabated with all major fiat currencies falling relative to gold. But at the same time over the past couple years gold has completely collapsed relative to Bitcoin; gold’s performance relative to Bitcoin is worse than the Argentina Peso against the USD.



The market has a way of financially rewarding the solutions, instead of refuges, because they add more value to society. And that is what gold’s currency collapse relative to Bitcoin is signaling; a massive wealth transfer has started from holders of assets in the traditional fiat currency system, gold, silver, etc. and other assets to holders of bitcoins.



Topics explored at depth by the American Monetary Association include Bitcoin, digital currencies, investing, corporate tax inversions, crowdfunding, inflation, the Federal Reserve, student loan debt, monetary policy, economic challenges facing generation Y, solar energy, 3D printing, medical technology, US dollar, currency exchange, plunging bond rates, personal and commercial bankruptcy, the cost of a college education, digital banking, the American dream, capital gains taxes, asset protection, gold and silver, commodities markets, precious metals, investing tips, structural and personal unemployment, bank regulations, regulatory reform, emerging markets, shadow banking, social media, derivatives, mobile commerce, government regulation, housing market, identity theft, cyber currencies, mortgage lenders, investment properties, VA loans, gold standard, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, online auctions, landlord tenant conflicts, tax lien investing, tax law, retirement, contract law, stagflation, home loans, real estate scams, renters, reverse mortgages, foreclosures, euro, European Union, ECB, European Central Bank, the US housing market, micro lending, online security, cyber security, online banking, digital banking, outsourcing, online shopping, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, JP Morgan, short sales, austerity, forex, monetary systems, budget surplus, budget deficits, tax cuts, solar energy, consumer debt, consumer price index, property investing, high frequency trading, interest rates, colle"

Chopper Prophets	"It was the fall of 2012. My wife and I were on a ride down to Encinitas, Ca. with some close friends. We were having some dinner and talking about bikes, riding, and other aspects of chopperin'. My brothers wife leans over and says, ""You should do a blog or podcast; something about choppers and interview people or something.""
My initial reaction was and I quote ""Lamest idea ever."" There were/are many excuses why I didn't want to start one, but I couldn't really come up with a valid reason why I shouldn't. Then it hit me... I love motorcycles, mostly noisy, greasy, oil leaking, hand built, choppers, but none the less I love them. After attending my first Born Free, meeting various people, and having an all around great time I realized that I wanted to share this love of two wheels and the people behind the machines with the world.
Chopper Prophets was born almost literally over a 24 hour period, but for everything to come together, it's been quite a ride. As I've recorded casts, read articles, blogs, Instagram posts, and met new people, I've felt this ever increasing desire to spread the gospel of chop. Not just the bikes, the builders, and the events, but the people. The people are what make this culture what it is and they are as unique as the bikes they build and/or ride.
It's not just about those who build or ride though. Chopperin' is a mental state that says ""I know how it's supposed to be, but I'm going to do it this way."" There are very few differences between a hacker and someone who has this mind set. They both end with something being taken apart and modified. I think that's what I love most of all about the culture.
So, here we are now. The Voice of Chopper Culture... or at least attempting to be."

Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen	"Austen’s timeless romantic classic, follows the lives of the five Bennett sisters, who live in a time where an advantageous marriage and social status are considered a fundamental for any woman to stand a fair chance at life. Set at the turn of the 19th century, Pride and Prejudice catches a perfect glimpse not only of a time when women were socially and economically dependent solely on their marital status, but also as an age of enlightenment and witness of the French Revolution.

This romantic novel with its hint of comic references begins with the famous quote ""It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.""
This famous quotation sets the story into motion as the eligible Mr. Bingley is introduced as he rides into town. The quote also draws in and to some extent reveals the content of the plot to come. Soon the news of the arrival of the well off Charles Bingley finds its way to the ears of the Bennett household. Having five unmarried daughters, the Bennetts are eager to match them up with suitable spouse candidates and see them prosperously married. After attending a ball, Mr. Bingley is instantly attracted to the oldest Bennett daughter Jane and it is fair to say that the feeling is mutual. Such cannot be said about his close friend Mr. Darcy who rudely refuses to dance with the second Bennett daughter Elizabeth. Consequently, Elizabeth’s first prejudice is born as she labels Mr. Darcy arrogant and obnoxious; however, she later learns never to judge a book by its cover and must swallow up her pride to achieve happiness. Pride and Prejudice witnesses the exciting courtships of the Bennett sisters and their suitors, as well as the not so joyful relationships of other characters. As the novel develops the relationships between the characters must outweigh the forces seeking to tear them apart. 

Experience the adventures of the Bennett sisters as they face the troublesome issues of manners, social class, family, and marriages in a male reliant society. A story not only portraying the unreliable nature of pride and prejudice, Austen’s classic also paints a vivid image of the past and the woman as a member of society."

The Love, Food Podcast: Peace from emotional eating, binge eating, eating disorders, and negative body image through intuitive	"Clean eating. Low carb. Low fat. Do this not that. Now what? Eating is getting too stuffy and complicated. Throw open your windows to allow a new stream of health, wellness, and peace.

What if you could write a letter to food? Pen to paper, you hash out the love/hate relationship and food’s undeserving power. Details go back years, to your first childhood diet trying to fit in. How you relate to food chronicles many of your life’s ups and downs.

In this letter, you examine your dusty food beliefs and wonder which go in the trash, are for others, and which remain in your heart.

What if you wrote this all down and food wrote you back? This is Love, Food.

Food behavior expert and host, Julie Duffy Dillon is rolling up her sleeves to get to the bottom of what is really healthy. This award-winning dietitian seen on TLC’s My Big Fat Fabulous Life has a secret: food is not your enemy and your body is tired of the constant attacks. 

Show topics include:

emotional eating
weight concerns
binge eating
orthorexia
body image
eating disorders
dieting
parenting and food
healthy eating
stress eating
food addiction
mindful eating
non diet approaches

Pull up a chair to your dusty kitchen table and set it for a meal. Ask food to sit alongside you and chat over coffee. Or a margarita. You have some reconnecting to do. In that connection is Love, Food. In that conversation is health and peace."

She Percolates with Jen Hatzung & Danielle Spurge	"Serving up a fresh perspective on success. Our mission is to introduce you to interesting and inspiring women who live all different versions of success. We believe success is an ever evolving concept - it is different for everyone. 

We believe life is about finding happiness despite detours and imperfections. Embracing the reality that you aren’t always going to have it together and quieting the voice in your head that says you haven’t “made it yet.” Appearing to have it all is not as important as feeling fulfilled for the day, week, month or year. Accepting and celebrating that what will make you feel fulfilled can and will change over time - and it's not the same for everyone.

We believe that authenticity is more important than perfection. Our most meaningful relationships and connections are created based on authenticity."

The Wonderful Wizard of Oz	"In this podiobook: From the Reader, Jason Pomerantz:The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has been called ""the first true American fairy tale"" and it richly deserves the title.  The story of Dorothy's epic journey through a strange land, filled with terrifying enemies and loyal allies, resonates today as much as it did when it was first written, at the turn of the last century.You've probably seen the movie countless times, so you might not expect any surprises from the book.  But when you listen, you'll be charmed by how imaginative it is, and in a way that's different from the film.I dearly love the movie, but, in this reading, I've tried to approach the story as if I'd never seen it.  My Dorothy is a little younger than her cinematic counterpart and her trio of beloved friends - The Scarecrow, The Tin Woodsman and The Cowardly Lion - are all just a little sillier.  It's hard to escape from the shadow of the MGM spectacular, but I've done my best.I hope you have as much fun listening as I'm having recording!So sit back, put on your slippers (ruby, silver or whatever color you like) and watch out for flying monkeys!  Load up your MP3 player and remember - There's no place like home!"

The radio portrayal of  Perry Mason is a far more involved lawyer then the one who became famous on TV, the radio version  would rather swap gunshots with evildoers than sit in a boring courtroom, waiting for the deliberation!  The show was only 10 minutes and was more intense and favored action than courtroom drama. Perry Mason ran 12 seasons and moved to TV in the late 1950's with the now famous portrayal by Raymond Burr.
Each show follows a continues story line similar to soap operas. Join us as we join Perry Mason in crime mysteries and court room drama."

Nocturne	"There are 24 hours in a day. Seems pretty straightforward. But what do you really know about the hours between say, 11pm-6am. From graveyard shift jobs to “secret identities”, who we are and what we do at night is often less fully perceived by others, whether by choice or by circumstance. Peering into the dusty corners of the night, Nocturne explores these often overlooked and undisclosed slices of life. Under cover of darkness, our thoughts and feelings can take on strange new shapes, sometimes barely recognizable as our own. And the pulse of the world seems to alter too, sort of creating a curtain of privacy around our behaviors and even our appearance. Do I truly know you if I only know the daytime you? Let’s find out in Nocturne. Nocturne is a member of The Heard, an awesome collective of sound-rich, story-driven podcasts.



Nocturne is essay radio - a hybrid form of audio storytelling that blends elements of documentary, fiction and sound-art.

Weekly Lost Podcast - Devoted to the ABC TV Show LOST!	"The Weekly Lost Podcast is where Cliff and Stephanie’s journey into the world of podcasting began back in 2005. While Stephanie had been watching LOST from the very first episode, Cliff had got hooked on the show after catching the last four episodes of the first season. For Cliff, it was the hidden clues and the overall mystery of the island that drew him in.
Cliff had initially started out blogging about Lost and listening to a small handful of Lost Podcasts. Many of Cliff’s blog posts highlighting easter eggs and unique theories were picked up by major media outlets like Entertainment Weekly. When Cliff was encouraged by Lost Podcasters, Ryan & Jenn Ozawa, to launch his own podcast, he jumped at the opportunity and convinced Stephanie to join him.
The rest is history which you can read on the GSPN Wikipedia page. While the show was on the air, Cliff and Stephanie produced two podcast episodes every week devoted to the show. They would record an initial reaction podcast immediately following the episode and then they would produce a full weekend review in a live audience setting on the gspn.tv live show page.
Now that the series has come to an end, the show is no longer produced on a “weekly” basis. However, more episodes of this podcast will be produced as they feel prompted to do so and as they have the opportunity to interview more members of the cast and crew from the show."

Decentralization is a huge component of moving people towards more freedom so, some of our episodes will look at the growing trend of decentralization in business and how flatter structures can result in better feedback and better products. Peaceful voluntary co-operation between individuals has been responsible for the enormous growth in human prosperity, and we believe that markets can and do provide services better than governments can. I hope you enjoy the podcasts and articles on this site. The purpose of the content is to demonstrate that voluntary co-operation between individuals is the best solution to problems.

Hilchos Shabbos with Ari Goldwag	In Jewish tradition, the Seventh day of the week is a special time of communion with God and spirituality. It is called Shabbos, or Shabbat, the day of rest. On this day we emulate that which the Creator did when He was involved in His creation. He spent six days in creative mode, and the seventh was a time for reflection on all He had done. This corresponds to the Kabbalistic concept of the male (which is represented by the number six), and the female (which is the number seven). The Jewish people are called the bride of God, and therefore, the special laws of Shabbos constitute a special covenant between God and Israel. This podcast seeks to study these laws, in all their intricate details, so we can fully develop our connection and relationship with God on this special day.

We’ll cover information on how to talk with your partner, equipment information, tips on technique, getting past the myths and misconceptions, success stories and much, much more.

Walden by Henry David Thoreau	"Two years, two months and two days! This is what forms the time line of one man's quest for the simple life and a unique social experiment in complete self reliance and independence. Henry David Thoreau published Walden in 1884. Originally drafted as a series of essays describing a most significant episode in his life, it was finally released in book form with each essay taking on the form of a separate chapter. 

Thoreau's parents were in financial straights, but rich intellectually and culturally. The young Henry was educated in the best of schools in their home town, Concord, Massachusetts and went on to graduate from Harvard, where he read history, philosophy, theology and literature. He commenced working as a school master in Concord but soon quit when he discovered that he was not ideologically suited to methods employed in those days which included corporal punishment. During this time, a chance meeting with the great philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emerson marked a turning point in his life. 

Deeply influenced by Emerson's ideas and his Transcendentalism cult, Thoreau embarked on the Walden experiment. The Transcendentalism movement was an amalgam of Buddhism, German and English Romanticism, Hindu teachings, Confucianism and placed great emphasis on emotional wellbeing, self reliance and personal truths rather than social norms. It rejected society's dominance over the individual. 

Walden Pond was located in a property owned by Emerson. Here, Thoreau built a cabin and proceeded to live a completely self sufficient life, gathering his own food and preparing it, sleeping and reading and appreciating nature as the whim took him. He meticulously recorded every experience and this forms the body of work known as Walden.  

The book received a lukewarm reception when it first appeared, but went on to gather cult status with the advent of the Flower Power generation, the anti-establishment movements against the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement. The concepts of individual freedom and individual choice became ingrained in the American psyche as a new generation of Americans re-discovered Walden.  

Walden's main appeal lies in its exploration of themes like solitude, economy, the simple life and the Higher Laws that he describes which relate to man's relationship to nature. Thoreau's style is attractive and easy, full of nuggets of folksy wisdom. Modern proponents of simplifying life, those who oppose our over reliance on technology and advocates of inner spiritual awakening are sure to find Walden a valuable and rewarding read."

The Alien Adventures of Finn Caspian: Science Fiction for Kids	"The Alien Adventures of Finn Caspian is a serialized science-fiction story for kids (start with Episode 1), told in 15-20 minute episodes for parents to put on when driving around town, or to marathon on road trips, or to bond over before bed. The story centers on Finn Caspian, an 8-year-old boy aboard The Famous Marlowe 280 Interplanetary Exploratory Space Station. He and his friends Abigail, Elias and Vale are Explorers Troop 301, taking off from the Marlowe to explore uncharted planets, help the occasional alien, and solve a mystery that threatens to destroy the Marlowe. When pressed, we describe it as a ""mystery gang"" story, sort of like Scooby-Doo in space.

The story is written and performed by Jonathan Messinger, author of Hiding Out, former web editor of Time Out Chicago Kids, and father of two boys. His son Griffin, 7, serves as editor of the story, appearing in episodes to critique, make predictions and express skepticism that his father knows what he's talking about, which also happens to be the way the rest of their relationship works."

Contagious by Scott Sigler	"From the acclaimed author of Infected comes an epic and exhilarating story of humanity’s secret battle against a horrific enemy.

Across America, a mysterious pathogen transforms ordinary people into raging killers, psychopaths driven by a terrifying, alien agenda. The human race fights back, yet after every battle the disease responds, adapts, using sophisticated strategies and brilliant ruses to fool its pursuers. The only possible explanation: the epidemic is driven not by evolution but by some malevolent intelligence.

Standing against this unimaginable threat is a small group, assembled under the strictest secrecy. Their best weapon is hulking former football star Perry Dawsey, left psychologically shattered by his own struggles with this terrible enemy, who possesses an unexplainable ability to locate the disease’s hosts. Violent and unpredictable, Perry is both the nation’s best hope and a terrifying liability. Hardened CIA veteran Dew Phillips must somehow forge a connection with him if they’re going to stand a chance against this maddeningly adaptable opponent. Alongside them is Margaret Montoya, a brilliant epidemiologist who fights for a cure even as she reels under the weight of endless horrors.

These three and their team have kept humanity in the game, but that’s not good enough anymore, not when the disease turns contagious, triggering a fast countdown to Armageddon. Meanwhile, other enemies join the battle, and a new threat — one that comes from a most unexpected source — may ultimately prove the most dangerous of all.

Catapulting the reader into a world where humanity’s life span is measured in hours and the president’s finger hovers over the nuclear button, rising star Scott Sigler takes us on a breathtaking, hyper-adrenalized ride filled with terror and jaw-dropping action. Contagious is a truly grand work of suspense, science, and horror from a new master. 

“An inventive, amped-up yarn . . . full of pressure-cooker mind games.”
—Entertainment Weekly

“A marvel of gonzo, in-your-face, up-to-the-minute terror. Sigler is masterful
at grabbing the reader by the throat and refusing to let go.”
—Lincoln Child, New York Times bestselling author of Deep Storm

“Fraught with tension . . . Invasion of the Body Snatchers meets The Hot Zone.”
—Rocky Mountain News

“Part Stephen King, part Chuck Palahniuk . . . a pulpy masterpiece of action, terror, and suspense.”
—James Rollins, New York Times bestselling author of The Judas Strain

“Riveting . . . leads the reader from one startling detail to the next . . . a terrifying page-turner.”
—Publishers Weekly (starred review) 

“Powerfully written . . . [with] an unforgettable central character. You’ll never listen to Cole Porter’s ‘I’ve Got You Under My Skin’ the same way again.”
—Dallas Morning News

“Once begun, not easily put down . . . leaves the reader’s heart still racing when
the last page is turned.”
—Roanoke Times"

Psychology Of Everything	Whether through a telescope, microscope, or stethoscope, we have been trying to understand ourselves and others for as long as any of us can remember or the history books have recorded.  In the past century and a half there has been a massive collection of information from numerous sources, comprising what we now refer to as psychology.  Yet, even though we have so much information, the general awareness or use of this technology is very limited.  Or worse yet, we think we “know” more than we really do.  Michael McClendon, PsyD (an honest to goodness shrink) plays host to topical experts who will help us dig into the data and make sense of the rich knowledge base that does exist, and how we can put that information to use.  Moreover, Michael has promised to leave the jargon in the classroom and talk about these topics in a way that makes sense and doesn’t require a special glossary of terms.

Albert Einstein said, “Everything in life is vibration.” You’re literally, energetically attracting career opportunities, good health, relationships, respect of your peers and sometimes even money, when you live at your optimal vibration. Tesla said, “If you want the secrets of the Universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration.” We explore how quantum physics meets psychology. We discuss how everything from the food you eat to your thoughts can raise or lower your vibration. When you discover the secrets to a high-vibration life you obtain health and happiness.

But who are we?  Fair question.  We’re Tom and Dave, Alabama graduates and big college football fans.  However, we have a unique and intense passion for the Alabama Crimson Tide.  
Over the years we’ve spent countless hours talking about the Alabama Football team and one day in 2010 we got the idea that we should turn our idle talk into a podcast, and so was born the Alabama Football Podcast.  The original podcast branded as such.

In early 2014 we were offered the opportunity to merge our football podcast with BamaHammer dot com, one of the leading Alabama sports sites around and we’re looking forward to using this platform to help us reach and forge relationships with even more Alabama fans who enjoy a little intelligent and opinionated football talk.

We trust you’ll enjoy our show and we welcome your feedback.  

We’re reachable via the BamaHammer website or directly at AlabamaFootballPodcast (@) gmail dot com.

In the meantime, Roll Tide."

Ancestral Findings (Genealogy Gold)	"Genealogy is the most wonderful of pastimes. I love it, and you should, too. There are endless reasons why. Genealogy is one of the fastest growing hobbies in the western world, as more and more people discover the exhilarating and slightly addictive nature of ancestor hunting. It’s like an ongoing mystery with clues you have to discover and then put together to come to conclusions about your family’s past. The mystery never ends, because there is no end to the amount of time you can potentially go back in history with your family research. Yet, the more you can discover, the more complete picture of your family you can put together. It’s insanely rewarding, and the more you do it, the more you will want to do it. That’s a given.

“A Buddhist approach to recovering from Addiction”


What is Refuge Recovery?
Refuge Recovery is an oriented path to freedom from addiction. This is an approach to recovery that understands; “All individuals have the power and potential to free themselves from the suffering that is caused by addiction”. We feel confident in the power of the Dharma, if applied, to relieve suffering of all kinds, including the suffering of addiction. This is a process that cultivates a path of awakening, the path of recovering from the addictions and delusions that have created so much suffering in our lives and in this world. 

Refuge Recovery is a systematic approach to training our hearts and minds to see clearly and respond to our lives with understanding and non-harming. You are entering a way of life that may be familiar to some and foreign to others. In the beginning some of it may seem confusing or counter-instinctual, and some of it is. But you will find that with time, familiarity and experience, it will all make perfect sense and will gradually become a more and more natural way of being.

Hello Refuge Recovery friends. These first series of guided meditations were recorded by Dave Smith and are offered here for you.  There will be guided meditations, Dharma talks pertaining to refuge recovery, interviews and stories. Stay tuned....more to come!"

Mindful Recovery with Robert Cox	Mindful Recovery is a podcast devoted to helping individuals who are struggling with trauma and addictions recover.  Mindfulness is a research based method for dealing with anxiety and trauma.  Psychological and neuroscience studies have found that it is possible to increase the growth of neuronal pathways and retrain our brains in coping with these issues.  Basic techniques like learning to pay attention to our own breathing and looking honestly and non-judgmentally at our hurt places can begin to create an emotional holding space that allows us to live without reacting to the pain and begin deciding how we want to act on the world we find ourselves in.  This becomes the beginning of recovery and, thus, the beginning of a new and abundant life in recovery.  Whether you struggle with anxiety, mental illness, complex trauma, PTSD, addictions or a multitude of other problems, becoming mindful in the way you live is the first step along that path.  I would be honored if this podcast could help you begin that journey.

The Undifferentiated Medical Student	The Undifferentiated Medical Student (TUMS) podcast is about helping medical students to choose a medical specialty and plan a career in medicine.  The list of career options available to medical students is large, but the time to explore them all is short.  Moreover, mentorship in medical school is lacking, and many medical students tackle the task of career planning alone, most struggling and almost all clutching to the hope that 3rd year clinical rotations will definitively resolve their remaining uncertainties about how they want to specialize. However, having been distracted by the relentless pace of their pre-clinical curricula and specter of Step 1, 3rd year medical students are eventually confronted with the reality that there are simply too many specialties to explore in one year and that they may not even get to finish their clinical rotations before important decisions about their careers need to be made (e.g., the planning of acting internships) if they are to be competitive applicants.  Thus, mentorless and clinically unexposed, many medical students are forced to make wholly uninformed decisions about their futures.  By interviewing at least one physician from each of the 120+ specialties listed on the AAMC's Careers in Medicine website 1) about their specialty, 2) how they decided this specialty was right for them, and 3) for advice about long-term career planning irrespective of the specialty they went into, this podcast aims to enumerate the details of every specialty and provide virtual mentorship on how best to go about moving past being an undifferentiated medical student.

Cooking with Archaeologists: Food, fieldwork, and stories.	"The purpose of this podcast is to share the stories and food recipes of the people who uncover our shared past-the field archaeologist. The field archaeologists is a unique individual. Their work is to excavate, recover, and survey our human past. In some sense they are modern-day nomads following the seasonal cycle of available work across the globe. Like all nomads they have few personal possessions and only live at one location for a short period of time. This non-traditional life is challenging in terms of having a “normal life” but with it comes unique experiences that few people get to enjoy. For the field archaeologist one of the most important experiences of their day is the shared evening meal.

The evening meal is probably the most important part of the day. This is when everyone comes together and shares food. Like traditional family meals this is when the day is discussed, stories are shared, and food is enjoyed.

Food is culture. It defines who we are and it is one of the cultural artifacts that brings people together. For the field archaeologist there are memories involved in the making and eating food that we the editors of this blog believe that are important to share with the world. What better way to learn and experience archaeology then from the women and men doing the hard work- the field archaeologist!"

iProcrastinate Podcast	"Dr. Timothy A. Pychyl, associate professor of psychology and director of the Procrastination Research Group (Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada), provides a series of short talks, interviews and question/answer podcasts that explain why we procrastinate and what we can do about it.  An award winning educator, Dr. Pychyl challenges his listeners to explore their daily choices to act or postpone acting on their intentions. Do we head to the gym as intended, or slouch back on the couch thinking ""I'll feel more like a workout tomorrow""? Do we tackle the task now, or do we avoid it arguing to ourselves that ""I work better under pressure""? From losing 10 pounds to changing personal habits, Pychyl, a personality psychologist, focuses on the breakdown of intentional action - a problem commonly called procrastination. This series expands on three main themes: 1) irrational delay that sabotages personal productivity, 2) personality attributes that contribute to self-defeating behaviours, and 3) situational factors that undermine our ability to take or sustain action.  Drawing on the research literature, topics include: self-handicapping, anxiety, self-regulation, perfectionism, will power, coping styles, effects on health and well-being, impulsivity, temporal discounting, motivation and even purpose in life. Of course, Dr. Pychyl doesnâ€™t leave his listeners with the problem itself. Once these key factors have been established, he turns his attention to techniques that facilitate self change, habit-breaking implementation intentions, as well as strategies that help each of us to â€œcarpe diem!â€?  The emphasis is on self-understanding, practical advice and tools for change. We guarantee that you will find this an engaging series of podcasts that will provide you with tactics to increase personal productivity and well-being."

Mastermind Talks Podcast (MMT)	The #1 Rated Business Podcast on iTunes is back! If you’re looking to build an enormous business to support your own ego, this probably isn’t the best investment of your time. If you value currency over legacy, or are seeking a “passive” or “lifestyle” business…again, this is probably not for you. I’ve been there, done that, and I can promise you the reality is not what you’ve built it up in your head to be. I have this saying that an entrepreneur is someone who goes from working in their business, to on their business. However, there’s a second tier of entrepreneur who goes from working on their business, to working on themselves. THAT is who this is for. Those who know that good is the enemy of great, and are never satisfied with “good” in any area of their life - whether it be their health, business, or relationships. This is for those who are willing to sacrifice the person that they are for the one they want to become. That is who I am dedicating my life to serving. If what I have said here resonates with you, stay with me. I am a firm believer that the wisest investment is wisdom, and my commitment to you is to condense decades of insights and knowledge into days. My philosophy is that if I am transparent about my story, you can leverage my wins while at the same time avoiding my losses.

7th Son: Book Two - Deceit (The Beta Version)	"AUTHOR'S NOTE: This is ""The Beta Version"" of this podiobook. 7th Son: Descent is now available as a print novel from St. Martin's Press. During the editorial process, significant changes and improvements were made to Descent's print manuscript. Character names were changed, and events at the end of the print novel were modified in ways that will impact the rest of the print trilogy. The print novel represents an official reboot of the 7th Son series.

Due to these changes, this ""Beta Version"" of Book Two: Deceit is no longer the ""official"" version of the podiobook. Please visit the 7th Son: Descent (The Print Edition) page to subscribe to the definitive beginning of the trilogy. You're welcome to continue the series with this version of Deceit, but understand that you will encounter slight inconsistencies in character names and plot references.

THE STORY
Two days ago, seven human clones -- John, Michael, Father Thomas, Dr. Mike, Jonathan, Jack and Kilroy2.0 -- were torn away from their ""normal"" lives to stop a ruthless plot created by their progenitor, a man code-named John Alpha. Their quest was a descent into conspiracy, violence and death.

The clones were successful in their mission, but victory was not without its price.

As 7th Son: Book Two - Deceit begins, the Beta clones are demoralized, reeling from their loss ... and about to learn that John Alpha's plans are far from over.

To prevent the next phase of Alpha's plan, John, Kilroy2.0, and the others must unearth more dark secrets about the government project from which they were spawned. They will experience the horrors of betrayal, and race cross-country to track John Alpha.

And they will finally realize the scope of Alpha's wrath -- the bloodshed the clones have witnessed is merely a prelude to the world-rending destruction to come. Unless they can stop it first.

Deceit is the second novel in J.C. Hutchins' 7th Son thriller trilogy."

Siraj Wahhaj	"Siraj Wahhaj was born as Jeffrey Kearse and raised in Brooklyn. His mother was a nurse and his father a hospital dietitian. His brother is writer and editor Gregory S. Kearse of Silver Spring, Maryland. He went to church religiously and went on to become a Sunday school teacher as a teenager in a Baptist church.[4] Wahhaj then later went on to the New York University on a partial scholarship. He also played basketball where he met a teammate who interested him in the Nation of Islam, an African-American movement. He subsequently converted to Islam.



In 1969 he ended his schooling and joined the Nation of Islam, changing his name to Jeffrey12x.[4] During this time he was vocal in his belief that “white people are devils."" He said of this, “I preached it. I taught it.”[5] Wahhaj says of his interest in the Nation: ""It wasn't the theology that attracted me to the Nation of Islam at all... It was the kind of do-for-self black pride.""



When Elijah Muhammed died in 1975, ""His teachings began to unravel in my mind"", and he became a Sunni Muslim with the encouragement of Muhammad's son Warith Deen Mohammed. Mohammed took over and reorganized the Nation of Islam, urging members to come to orthodox Islam. Kearse then changed his name again to Siraj Wahhaj, which means ""bright light"" in Arabic. He was chosen to study Islam at the Umm al-Qura university of Mecca for a period of four months in 1978.[5] He also briefly taught a course in Islamic studies at Howard University, where Johari Abdul-Malik is the chaplain."

A Scottish Podcast | The Audio Drama Series	"'A Scottish Podcast' is a serialised modern audio drama.

It chronicles the story of Lee, a washed up former radio DJ who launches a paranormal investigation podcast.

Lee wants to see his show The Terror Files mentioned up there alongside podcasts like The Black Tapes, Limetown, and The Message. And he’ll stop at nothing to achieve it. 

Aided by his jaded musician pal Dougie, the pair travel the length and breadth of the country in search of Medieval Demon Kings and Lovecraftian Gods of the Sea. 

So why not join them on this unique tour of the ancient and mystical lands of Scotland? 

You’ll walk through the long-forgotten catacombs under Edinburgh. Sail out to the lonely and abandoned island of St.Caillic. Visit dingy pubs, run-down industrial estates, and obscure non-league football grounds.  

The show contains strong language, “adult situations” (whatever that means), and isn’t for the easily offended."

The Bridge	"It's an alternate 2016, and Watchtower 10 sits in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, keeping lonely watch over the Transcontinental Bridge. Each watchtower sits hundreds of feet away from the Bridge, broadcasting regular traffic reports to ensure that proper safety precautions are taken. These lighthouses (for cars) are filled with a carefully selected (and very capable) crew.

Watchtower 10's necessary personnel happen to be: a generalist DJ who spends her free time relaying folklore from abandoned parts of the Bridge, her supervisor (who's only there because he lost a bet), an unfailingly optimistic Bridge Travel Agent, and a groundskeeper who has a thing for romantic comedies. 

Unbeknownst to the general public (but totally knownst to each watchtower's crew), these stations also hold a secret that could potentially destroy the world...or save it.

The Bridge is a fictional serialized fantasy podcast about the monsters we fear, the monsters we can become, and the stories we leave behind."

When you really love coming together in real life with like-minded practitioners, but your schedule is dictated by playdates, laundry loads, and the precious moments of adult conversation or pursuit of some kind of career beyond wiping noses and bums? And when your practice of the Craft itself is at its most fulfilling and powerful when you are in the in-between places--dawn, twilight, midnight, a foggy beach, the edge of a forest, a space in the hedge? It's hard to describe, but it's exhilerating: the creative tension when and where you are about to cross over, from one world to the next, one time to the next, one role to the next. Life is constant change and flux, and in this miasma we shape ourselves and our reality. Come explore it all as we have, two modern, down-to-earth, real-life-concerns, practicing Witches, in the conversations of Betwixt and Between.

Another highlight of this chapter is the enumeration of some important values that prepare the mind to gain self-knowledge.
            
            The entire collection of Swamiji's talks is available at the Poornalayam website."

One Among the Sleepless	"""SEX, DEATH, AND NOISY NEIGHBOURS""

A killer has come to town. The victims are connected; each pointing to the next, as if in answer to the question: Who is The One?

Is it Peter Reynolds: mild-mannered office clerk pouring petrol through his neighbour’s letterbox in the middle of the night?

Is it Wayne Dolan: a man whose sexual fantasies about his neighbour spiral into dangerous obsession when he learns of her secret life as a dominatrix?

Or is it Gaz: leader of three friends who love nothing more than sex, weed and partying? All women are easy prey for his charms. All except Sally. And the one who doesn’t want him, is the one he has to have – whether she likes it or not.

Mick Nixon has to find the connection, because people are disappearing - and if he and Sally are ever going to share more than just lunch, he’d better hurry up, or they could be next.

A dark, funny, and at times horrific ride, One Among the Sleepless is a thriller set just below the surface of suburban existence. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll throw it through your neighbour’s window tied to a house brick!

STS9 Podcasts	"Since forming in Atlanta, GA over 15 years ago, instrumental electronic rock band STS9 has experienced an unceasing meteoric rise to the forefront of the international music scene. 
 
STS9 is Hunter Brown (guitar/sequences), Jeffree Lerner (percussion), David Phipps (keyboards/synths) and Zach Velmer (drums) and Alana Rocklin (bass).
 
From headlining stages at America’s largest festivals, to selling out shows around the country as an acoustic set-up in legendary opera houses or as an electronic rock act in amphitheatres, to even performing with the likes of Jay-Z in arenas, to running their own record label, 1320 RECORDS, STS9 truly does it all.  The band consistently lands themselves on Pollstar Magazines top touring charts in the country, with recent average attendance of over 5,000 fans per city.
 
In 2015, fans will be treated to STS9’s largest touring production rig ever, using the latest cutting edge sound and lighting to deliver one of the most visually stunning shows on the road today with undeniable sound to match it.
 
The band’s last studio EP, WHEN THE DUST SETTLES (the eleventh album in their full discography), keeps with XLR8R Magazine’s exclamation that STS9 is ""one of the country's most intriguing, innovative outfits around.” It debuted at #1 on the iTunes Electronic Charts and in Billboard’s Top 25.  
 
STS9’s self-owned record label, 1320 RECORDS was founded on the principles of collaboration, cooperation, and community. The goal is clear: bring the music to the people in the most conscious, unique innovative and savvy ways possible.  1320 currently boasts over 300,000 unique downloads and over 1,000 releases by over 100 artists including Bassnectar, Pretty Lights, Big Gigantic, ESKMO, The Glitch Mob plus dozens more.

Science Fiction and Politics, Courtney Brown, Emory University	"Science Fiction and Politics Class, Courtney Brown, Emory University. 
It has long been known that science fiction often seeks to foretell future technological developments. 
But it is also true that much science fiction foretells social science, and it can offer explicit commentaries on the political and social evolution of our societies. 
Isaac Asimov's depiction of the new science of psychohistory, Fritz Lang's biting critique of human society in his science fiction movie ""Metropolis,"" and H.G. Well’s similarly powerful perspective on social and political development as portrayed in his novel ""The Time Machine,"" are just a few examples. 
This seminar examines the role of science fiction as a powerful vehicle for social and political commentary, especially as it relates to the evolutionary tendencies of human societies."

Live Awake	"The Live Awake podcast helps bring you back to your grounded center through reflection and guided meditation. 

This podcast lends a new outlook to some of life's hard landscape. Perspective is everything, and by choosing to live awake to all that blooms in front of us we begin to live a more empowered life where joy becomes our natural state of being rather than something we occasionally stumble upon.  Through living awake we become conscious participants in our life’s unfolding.

At the end of each episode you will be guided through a short meditation on the topic at hand to help loosen the spots we can feel victim to. By doing this we come to understand we can choose not our usual, painful unconscious habits but instead to live from a place of grounded awareness, free from suffering.  

Live awake is for all those devoted to their hearts, devoted to the soul behind their ribs that came here to grow and expand, to all those devoted to learning, respecting and honoring the ways they are being called to do so. 

It is a place where one can come to close their eyes and rest a while on their breath, and see all they trouble and toil alongside is truly a gold lined cloud, holding a message of great hope and learning cradled within it."

The Fat Lip	"The Fat Lip is a podcast for and about fat people.

In some ways fat people are living in a different world than our thin and average-sized peers. Our lives and our experiences are influenced by our fatness all the time, but the outside reactions to fatness can really f**k us up. On a daily basis we are exposed to media that tells us that we’re not worthy of representation and a multi-billion dollar diet industry that is happy to take our money (for products that are proven to not work) while barely disguising its disgust at our very existence. It’s gross, and we’re over it.

TFL strives to be fat positive in a world that often isn’t. We are proud supporters of radical self-love and the fierce defense of your body autonomy.  Fat is not an indicator of health or fitness, and health and fitness aren’t moral imperatives anyway. You don’t have to justify your body or your health to anyone!

On The Fat Lip, you an expect frank discussion of fat issues in popular media, exploration of fatphobia as it intersects with other forms of oppression, real stories about living, working, and dating in a fat body, big serious topics like the politics of the &amp;amp;quot;obesity epidemic&amp;amp;quot; and tiny fun topics like fatshion and snacks. Plus a whole lot more!"

Weekly, Matt and his inspiring network share ""rise and fall, and rise again"" stories along with the new secrets of success while imparting inspiration and motivation.

Suspect Convictions	"The burning corpse of a 9-year old girl was found on a school playground in Davenport, Iowa, September 17, 1990.

Within days of the discovery of Jennifer Lewis’ charred body, police arrested Stanley Liggins, an African American who had just been released from prison. An Iowa jury convicted him and after 26-years behind bars, an appellate court has granted him a new trial.

The court’s decision was prompted by allegations of hidden evidence and potential police misconduct. Liggins will stand trial in May 2017. And once again, the question will be asked: Who killed Jennifer Lewis?

Veteran journalist Scott Reeder, who was at the crime scene the night Jennifer was killed, has conducted a massive investigation examining evidence in the case, interviewing witnesses and exploring the lives of both the victim and the accused. Troubling new developments have been uncovered. Reeder teamed with the NPR affiliate, WVIK, to produce this podcast: “Suspect Convictions.”"

podcasts – Yarns at Yin Hoo	"I learned to crochet in a professional development course called “Crochet for Stress Relief.” I had never been much of a crafty person — but I fell in love with the fiber arts. A few years later, I learned to knit by watching video tutorials. Next, I took my first spinning class and purchased a Louet. When my mother discovered a loom in her attic, I took it home. The setting for all of this crafting is a lovely tea house near Delaware Water Gap, PA. 
I’ve been a longtime listener of audio podcasts and I’m happy to add my contribution with Yarns at Yin Hoo, which I will release in August of 2013."

Through studying Human Factors we learn to combat the worst enemy to our flying success; ourselves. How can we become better aviators by interacting with our airplanes more effectively? How can we overcome the shortcomings of our human condition to make better decisions on the flight deck? 



We believe in learning to a confidence level, not learning to a level required by law. When you get a license, you should be ready to go out and fly in those conditions, with those aircraft, and do so with refined skills. 



Flight simulators these days are very advanced, and we will discuss how you can sure up your flight training with a home based simulator, giving you limitless hours and practice in IFR with scenario based training. 



Learn how to fly, become better at your flying craft, mold into a safer pilot, or perfect your professional skills.

Lyme Ninja Radio - Learn ninja skills to battle chronic Lyme disease | brain fog | fatigue | overwhelm |	"Sometimes it seems like you need Ninja skills to defeat Lyme disease. Join acupuncturist Mackay Rippey and his producer, Aurora, as they bring you interviews with interesting and informative people who are using their unique skills and knowledge to deal with Lyme and other tick born diseases. 

My name is Mackay Rippey, I'm an acupuncturist in Clinton, NY (http://www.mackayrippey.com)and the host of Lyme Ninja Radio. 

I'll never forget the Sunday morning I dragged my sorry-feeling-self to the bathroom and found a perfectly formed bullseye on my left arm. I was lucky, able to return to my acupuncture practice after only few days. It's possible to beat the bacteria that are making you sick. I have and so have many others, but you have to be smarter than Lyme. That's why I created Lyme Ninja Radio.

Join us as we talk to some of the most interesting people in the Lyme community."

Wolf 359	Life's not easy for Doug Eiffel, the communications officer for the U.S.S. Hephaestus Research Station, currently on Day 448 of its orbit around red dwarf star Wolf 359. He's stuck on a scientific survey mission of indeterminate length, 7.8 light years from Earth. His only company on board the station are stern mission chief Minkowski, insane science officer Hilbert, and Hephaestus Station's sentient, often malfunctioning operating system Hera. He doesn't have much to do for his job other than monitoring static and intercepting the occasional decades-old radio broadcast from Earth, so he spends most of his time creating extensive audio logs about the ordinary, day-to-day happenings within the station. But the Hephaestus is an odd place, and life in extremely isolated, zero gravity conditions has a way of doing funny things to people's minds. Even the simplest of tasks can turn into a gargantuan struggle, and the most ordinary-seeming things have a way of turning into anything but that. Wolf 359 is a radio drama in the tradition of Golden Age of Radio shows. Take one part space-faring adventure, add one part character drama, and mix in one part absurdist sitcom, and you get Wolf 359. New episodes are released every two weeks.

Dress Code Cracker: the podcast -- style and communication	"Dress Code Cracker discusses personal expression through style. 
Far outside the confines of mainstream consumer fashion culture, we consider pop culture, politics, modern art and feminism in discussing style as a means of personal expression. 
We talk to one guest bi-weekly about what they express when they get dressed and what informs their style.  Using an audio format forces a visual medium to be translated verbally. 
We look at dress as a daily exercise in creative self-expression, including as an expression of political beliefs. Dress can be a way to consider issues of oppression: via globalization/fast fashion, gender politics, race, feminisms, ableism and various types of 'body fascism'. 
Not to forget also how dress references culture and subculture. 
Dress code cracker is body and sex positive.

The RV Entrepreneur with Heath Padgett	"Living and traveling in an RV used to be only for retirees or the occasional family vacation. But over the past few years there has been a new movement of young RVers who have intentionally chosen to live with less stuff, be mobile, and take their lives on the road. This podcast is for people who are interested in downsizing their life, creating remote income, and working from anywhere.
The RV Entrepreneur Podcast is a weekly show where I interview nomadic entrepreneurs who have made the leap into the RV lifestyle and have taken their businesses with them on the road. My name is Heath Padgett and in 2014 I quit my job in software sales to go on a year long RV trip across America with my newlywed wife. After spending a year on the road and traveling to all 50 states, we realized that returning back to “life as normal” in a 9-5 job wasn’t going to fly. Instead, we spent 2015 building up a remote income through our online business and freelance video skills, paying off over $14k of student debt in the process. On this podcast, I'll share everything I learn about how to make money while traveling, based on my own experiences and full-time RVer guests. Unlike most business-related podcasts, the entrepreneurs who I bring on my show aren’t millionaires, just normal people who have created remote income streams that allow them to work from anywhere and travel the world."

Ten Junk Miles	"A lighthearted conversation by trail, road, and ultra runners about their lives as runners and the issues that are interesting or important to them and guests of the show.  TJM is meant to be a companion to you as you run.  Think of us as your running partners on days when you just need some friends to get you out on an easy run.  The show is composed of 10 segments, one for each mile, and every 10 minutes or so we move on to the next topic, to keep things interesting.  Among the hosts' experience are ten 100-mile finishes, dozens of half and full marathons, plenty of 50-milers, and some speedy 5ks and a BQ (and a handful of DNFs).
Scott Kummer is an attorney, doberman owner and quite possibly the most painstakingly average runner known to man.  Scott has stumbled through numerous plus 4 and 5 hour marathons.  He's DNF'ed the 150 mile, 100 mile, 50 mile and marathon distance.  He was once kicked out of an ultra runing group due to allegations of cyber-bullying.  He has a habit of offending people by accident while trying to help them.  He is a co-founder of the Flatlander Ultrarunners in Chicagoland which has rapidly grown to over 600 members.  He came up with the idea for Ten Junk Miles after becoming frustrated with hearing interview after interview of Scott Jurek and deciding that runners needed more: more discussions of bathroom breaks that went wrong, pacer stories from hell, DNF reports, stories of getting lost on the trail and other related matters.
Tony Silvestri, father, husband, ultra runner, took up podcast production on a whim in 2015 to help out the show. Simply put, if Al Gore hadn't invented the internet, Tony would have. He can grill a pizza on an open flame. He can create (and end) long lasting friendships faster than you can say ""turn over a new leaf."" He's still waiting for that first 100. Sometimes he talks wayyyyy too much on the show but we overlook that, because it is a little known fact that he once stopped a coyote from attacking the gang with a cold dad stare.
Amy Briggs was born with a piano attached to her fingers.  Given no choice, she took up the Tuba.  Not really.  She teaches piano at one of the top 5 Universities in the country and has played with with the Chicago Symphony, one of the best in the world.  When she is not focused on being at the top of her rather unusual field she hits the trails and Chicago Lakefront Path, training her ass off for her first 100 miler at Kettle Morraine in 2016 to accentuate her already stellar performances at the Marathon, 50K and 50 Mile distance.
Aaron German is a speedster, plain and simple.  He's the only one in the group that has ever cracked the three hour marathon barrier and the only one brave enough to wear mandex in public. He's a Kansas City native and University of Chicago grad that found out by accident that losing tons of weight can make you run faster.  Aaron trades stocks and fantasy baseball players while juggling the lack of commitments that comes with having no wife, no kids and no real job.  In short, Aaron has nothing better to do than run long and fast and think about funny things to say.

Inner Perspectives: Guideposts for the Spiritual Journey	"Elizabeth Clare Prophet, modern mystic and pioneer in New Age spirituality, answers more than 300 questions about the Teachings of the Ascended Masters in weekly 15-minute podcasts offering insights into life’s deepest mysteries and secrets of the mystical paths of the world’s religions. 

Accelerate your journey to enlightenment with questions like: 

What do Jesus and Saint Germain have in common? Everybody can become the Christ or the Buddha, how many have succeeded? Who are the ascended masters? 

What is the Chart of Your Divine Self? 

What were the ""lost years"" of Jesus and how did he learn about the Buddha? Is everybody both masculine and feminine at the same time? 

What about twin flames, soul mates and karmic marriages? How do we raise our sacred energies? 

Can we command God? How to effect positive change using the creative power of sound, decrees and the Science of the Spoken Word. Did Jesus use mantras? How can we overcome bad habits? What is the path of initiation? 

Is it possible to end physical death? What is resurrection and ascension? Is immortality possible? 

Is physical healing and spiritual wholeness the same thing?  Is instantaneous healing possible? 

What is it like to visit an etheric retreat of the masters and how do you get there? What does the flame in the heart have to do with the path of discipleship in the Aquarian age?

What are the seven rays, chohans, colors and qualities? What do the seven rays have to do with the seven chakras? Who is El Morya? How do we know what the will of God is for us? How can someone in the West profit by the wisdom of the East? What is the relationship between love and art? Who is Serapis Bey and what are the requirements for the ascension?  What about agnostics and atheists? How great is the power of prayer? 

How the Great White Brotherhood is about light, not race.  Ancient black history of the violet race in Africa. 

Become the Buddha? Why isn’t reincarnation primarily an Eastern idea. The difference between what Jesus taught his disciples and what he taught to the world at large. Does reincarnation take away the sense of personal responsibility?  What happens to people who will not take responsibility for balancing their own karma? Don't people go to heaven or hell? 

What happened to the real meat of Christ's teaching? Can the soul die? Does the Spirit die? How do we know that Jesus intended us to be like him? 

Do you see the aura in Kirlian photography?  Does the aura ever lie? What do the colors of the aura mean? What’s the difference between that intuitive feeling we get about each other, ESP and reading the aura? 

If all people are created equal, why are there people of such light and darkness on earth? What role do angels play in determining the nature of our auras? How can we strengthen our aura? How can we unlock the creativity and mastery that are the energy and consciousness of God? What about guilt? How have people become alienated at subconscious levels? What is the true meaning of destiny? 

How did Mary prepare to be Jesus’ mother in her previous embodiments? Is Atlantis real? What do you mean when you talk about the Coming Revolution in higher consciousness? 

Is Saint Germain's message for all or just the few who are into mystical teachings? What does the violet flame and the seventh ray have to do with the Aquarian Age. Is it possible for someone with lesser attainment than Jesus or Saint Germain to use the laws of alchemy? 

What is the meaning of the word evil? How does the practice of alchemy affect the law of supply and demand? How do you know what God's will is? How can we put this knowledge of the will of God to work for alchemy and for change in our lives? .

casadeferro.com	"who is ricardo ferro?
Ricardo is also known as DJ Ferro since his debuts in the world of djing, bringing us back to 1988. Very loyal to the electronic culture club since then, Ferro has become a key name of the Portuguese underground music scene.

Born in Lisbon in 24th April 1973, he spent his early days in the well-known region of Algarve, southern Portugal. When he turned 18 years old he moved back to Lisbon on his own, not only because the attraction of the big city life but mainly because of his strong desire of getting to know artists and people involved in the dance scene. He was eager to make a breakthrough as well as establishing his style and own sound to a bulky audience.

It was only a matter of time, for those who remember, before his name started circulating around the elite and was being offered to playing in such places like: Locomia, Rocks, ZONA+, Coconuts, Plateau, Alcantara-Mar amongst others.

When still working in the record shop Bimotor in charge of the imports, he formed a collective with A.paul and Wogz, two successful Techno Dj’s in Portugal, which would lead to the creation of a specific Portuguese techno label - Squeeze Records. Squeeze 001 ( A.paul & Ferro) appeared to be the so much wanted breakthrough, a smash! The right music was released at the right time and obviously the interest of the public kept growing. The next step was a very much awaited and acclaimed Compilation.

Outside Portugal boundaries the success was discreet but flourishing. The German distributor Neuton shipped Squeeze around Europe and DJs like Sven Vath, Chris Liebing and Hardfloor charted it. At a certain point, during the ’boom’ of dance music in Portugal, X-Club acknowledged his work with a invitation to be one of the X artists, were he finally was able to set up his career. Places like Colombia and Slováquia, playing with DJs like Carl Cox, Jeff Mills, Dave Clarke, Richie Hawtin, The Advent, Mike Dearborn, DJ Rush, Derrick Carter, Dave Angel, Darren Price, Stacey Pullen, DJ Sneak, Green Velvet, Josh Wink, Damon Wild, Steve Stoll, Adam Beyer, Ben Long and many others, are common to him.

Today Ricardo Ferro is the Label Manager of FAROL, the label of Media Capital and also the exclusive distributor of Warner Music in Portugal. His love for production is still alive, and he regularly delivers his new material. He also keeps his agenda full with gigs in Portugal and abroad.

In less than a decade, Ricardo Ferro managed to impose his fresh sound and smooth style with a clever blend of Techno, Techouse, Hardhouse, Progressive House, House and even Electro, his recent collaboration with Mourah under the project Echosonic is an example of it.

Year after year he proves to his faithful audience to be an innovative, versatile and open-minded artist. One who deserves all the respect he has been rewarded with.

Agent Marketing Syndicate: Real Estate | Broken Industry | Fighting The Guru Party | Ryan Fletcher	Ryan Fletcher. Welcome to the Agent Marketing Syndicate Podcast. It’s an unfortunate truth, but “The Guru Party,” made up of the trainers, brokers & endless supply of coaches—and what they teach—are the architects responsible for bankrupting the real estate industry of trust. Because of them. The term “real estate agent,” in the eyes of society, has become a stain on your reputation. This podcast is the solution. As you know, I’ve been blessed. I’ve had so many wonderful things happen to me. And I’ve made wonderful things happen by virtue of the opportunities available to me, and by “seeing” the clearing through the fog. The Guru Party’s message, though, is that you must hunt and beg and demean yourself in a variety of “standard” ways to be successful in real estate. Like, “Prospecting is your job.” I reject that. The spirit of the Entrepreneur knows no limits. It would be shameful to waste it on prospecting. An activity of such low-status. To rise to new heights, though, you must understand the truths that enable you to defy “the gravity” that others tell you cannot be escaped. They are wrong. Their ‘lack of skills’ and ‘limited ambition’ blinds them to what is possible. This podcast, undoubtedly, will infuriate The Guru Party. They will reject it. That’s Ok. By the majority of low-information agents too, it will be rejected. Again, that's OK… because in time, after enough pain is experienced and suffered, enough struggle is endured, enough frustration is dealt with—they will come around. They will smarten up. They will wise up. They will realize The Guru's Party's approach has failed them for fundamental reasons. And they will stop trying to deny or outflank the reality of the truths presented on this podcast. They are, after all, undeniable…truths. For more, visit: www.FightTheGuruParty.com

1 Day Business Breakthrough - Helping Entrepreneurs Discover Their Next Big Idea Today |1DayBB	"Welcome to the 1 Day Business Breakthrough (1DayBB) Podcast! Each episode features the voice of one real-life business owner who shares their most painful struggle, followed by a 15-minute ""hotseat"" where entrepreneur hosts Pat Flynn and Chris Ducker go back-and-forth to brainstorm, share ideas and develop strategics, tactics and tips to help that person break through their struggle. Each episode ends with both Pat and Chris sharing what each of their next steps would be. 

1DayBB started as a small, in-person event in San Diego where Pat and Chris would bring in 20 entrepreneurs and have them spend 15 minutes in the ""hotseat""  to present their biggest struggle while the entire room would collaborate and mastermind to help that person find their breakthrough. All of this in one day. Hence, 1-Day Business Breakthrough.

The first 1DayBB event was held in 2013 and it was a massive success! Since then, Pat and Chris have held many more 1DayBB events, including one in Australia. Tickets for every event have sold out within 24 hours.

Despite being massively popular, the small mastermind events are also extremely limited. The high demand for more gave Pat and Chris the idea for the 1DayBB podcast, adopting the same hotseat format to provide the most value to those featured on the show, and to those listening as well.

It doesn't matter what kind of business you have, what your target market is or what level you're at. The 1DayBB format provides the most value for your time possible. At the live events, all of the attendees agree: although their time in the hotseat was fantastic, it was their ability to listen to other people's hotseats that was the most helpful and inspiring. 

Of course, we haven't forgotten about the community aspect of the 1DayBB format either. If you go to 1DayBB.com/community, you can join in on the mastermind conversation about each episode as they come out. 

And finally, we couldn't hold back from continuing our live events, although we're opening it up to attendees in a much bigger way, and you won't even have to fly in to attend. For more information about our upcoming live event, visit 1DayBB.com/live."

From practical techniques to sexual philosophy, you’ll learn you how to have better sex and more of it; in a friendly atmosphere that doesn’t demean or coddle.

Yet, we are all human. There are certain ideas which apply to all of us, no matter if we are standing at 29,029 feet or sea level. Why is it important to step outside of our comfort zone? How do we weigh risk vs. reward? What impact does human behavior have on our decision making? On MtnMeister, we explore these ideas by talking with those who have found answers in the extremes.

Ben Schenck, the host of MtnMeister (pronounced Mountain Meister), asks thought-provoking and sometimes uncomfortable questions that you won't hear in a typical interview. Notable guests include Alex Honnold, Sasha DiGiulian, Ueli Steck, Jeremy Jones, Lynn Hill, Conrad Anker, Aaron Gwin and other adventurers in climbing, skiing, hiking, biking, and everything else in the mountains."

Who cares? What's the point? A psychology podcast with Dr Sarb Johal	"Join me as I track down cutting edge psychology researchers from around the world publishing thought-provoking research about why we behave the way we do. 

We have so many talented researchers around the globe, all trying to understand how the mind works and how we can harness its full potential for the benefit of ourselves, the people around us and the planet.  But, because of the way the science system works we have ended up with a gigantic amount of untapped knowledge about how the mind and brain works, that sits unused in dusty journals on University library shelves - because very few people read them.  Partly this is down to access – more often than not, you have to pay to read these. But partly its because, well, why would you bother? They tend to be dry, soulless publications, written by academics for academics. 

This podcasts changes that.

When I was a PhD student, one of the slides me and a few of my fellow students included in every presentation we did said this; 'Who cares? What's the point?"" This encouraged us to really double down and focus on why anyone should care about the research we were doing.

This podcast will do the same thing. 

I will invite psychologists from around the world to tell us briefly about their research, and then I will prompt them to answer those two questions – who cares? And what’s the point, focusing on the possible implications of their work. 

This way, you get to hear stories about how the brain works, without putting your mind to sleep."

The Primal Happiness Show: Happiness | Self-help | Primal | Personal Development | Success | Self-improvement | Love | Mindset	"[Previously The Born Happy Show] Reclaim Your Primal Happiness and Discover How to Thrive In This Crazy, Modern World.

Want to be happier? Whether you're struggling with insecurity, fear, procrastination, a lack of confidence, anxiety, panic or stress, or you'd just like a happier, more successful, creative, meaningful and fun life... this is the show for you! 

The Primal Happiness Show is about ‘Primal’ meaning intrinsic, fundamental and natural, and ‘Happiness’ meaning the state of being at ease, connected and in flow. So we’re saying that just like everything else in nature, happiness is our primal state.

But the thing is… the world today is a crazy place. We’re living in unnatural times, which has resulted in most of us being disconnected from our natural state.

This show is designed to reconnect you!

Even if you've done so much self-help, personal development or self-improvement that you could write the book on them, you'll find this show is something completely different to anything you've come across before.

There's interviews and coaching sessions with well-known self-help, happiness or Three Principles experts - such as Supercoach Michael Neill, best-selling author Steve Chandler, Timber Hawkeye of Buddhist Bootcamp and Jamie Smart, the best-selling Clarity author - and they're all pointing the way back to true happiness.

We take people on an incredible journey to discover the fundamentals required to access our primal state.  All without having to move to a planet that's not so crazy as ours. :)"

Arc Stories	Arc Stories is simply stories. Imagine you're finishing dinner. Maybe you’re at a party, maybe it’s your family’s Sunday supper. You push back from the table while coffee is poured. You congregate out on the front porch because it’s cool enough now. Maybe the first sign of what’s to come is a laugh-tinged “You will never believe what happened to me at work...”  Or a wistful “Do y’all remember that time...”  But it always comes. Here, in our little corner of the country, they always come. The South has always marked time by its stories. They carry our history. Our fathers and grandfathers. Wars. Hunting trips. Good dogs. Great loves. Brass badges and bank robbers. Our everyday lives.  Arc Stories is the celebration of that great tradition. It is the chance for our stories to move off the front porch, or from around the campfire, or out of the coffee house, and be put on stage in front of friends and strangers alike.

The Freedom Formula for Physicians | How Doctors Cut Debt & Slash Taxes |  Business Of Medicine | Financial Education	"My name is Dave Denniston. I started podcasting in 2014 as my way of paying back physicians for helping my family with our miracle child, Evangeline, who was born at a mere 12.4 ounces/ 23 weeks gestationally.
Through this journey, I've had the honor of interviewing Dr. Jim Dahle (The White Coat Investor), Dr. Kevin Pho (KevinMD), Dr. Pamela Wible, Dr. Dike Drummond, Dr. Nii Darko, and so many more.
This is my personal podcast, dedicated to physicians. It is focused on “financial freedom” and just as importantly,  how physicians can engage in healthy & a prosperous mindset! My philosophy is that we can all learn from others and who better to talk to physicians than other physicians and experts in various areas!
I want to see every physician lower their taxes, destroy their debt, and enjoy a joyous, liberated lifestyle so that they can focus on what they love most- their families, their patients, and the activities that give them joy.
I speak and interview folks on a whole host of issues that are important to physicians- burnout, how to protect their families, divorce, taxes, medical school debt, how to be a blogger & author, how to start an independent practice, and much more. I also occasionally speak about the resources that I am discovering.
My goal is to create insightful, relevant content that you can put to work in your personal and professional life. If you are a physician- or aspire to be- then this podcast is for you!
I typically post once per week, sometimes more often. Make sure to subscribe and stay tuned. The best is yet to come!"

Artist Decoded by Yoshino	"""I started this series as a means for exploration, an exploration of self and an exploration of the perspectives of other artists.
 
This series is an unabridged documentation of conversations between artists.  It’s a series dedicated to breaking down the barriers we tend to set up in our own mind.  I want to inspire future creatives to have the courage to explore and experiment.  This is about making dreams a reality and not about letting our dreams fall to the wayside.
 
My intention is to give my audience a sense of real human connection, something that feels rich and organic.
 
When I was thinking of a title I thought of the word “movement”. 
In relation to the Renaissance period in art, my goal for this program is to signify a rebirth of consciousness towards the way we look at contemporary art.""

In other words, it’s about living life with purpose.

Looking into the realm of the ""deep mind"" a place where conventional science has ignored, is what we do and we want to open the path for everyone to follow.

Science has little to say about consciousness.  As psychics we do see into the ""here and the hereafter""!

Join us here on the Psychic View as we delve into some of the ways you as an individual can open your spirit and move into the consciousness field."

Phil Rossi weaves a tale that is reminiscent of old school Stephen King but with a shiny, new set of tricks and an appetite to terrify.   There's sex. There's corruption. There's horror.  And after you sweat your way through the first chapter, there's plenty more to keep you awake at night.Crescent features an original soundtrack written and performed by the author. ""... what is right now, my addiction -- Crescent. I'm waiting to see what happens with the freakin' story.  *I* do this to people, other people don't do this to me!"" -- Scott Sigler, author of Infested (Infection), Earthcore, and Ancestor.""If you're debating about subscribing to Crescent, I've got one question: Why are you hesitating?

7th Son: Book One - Descent (The Beta Version)	"AUTHOR'S NOTE: This is ""The Beta Version"" of this podiobook. 7th Son: Descent is now available as a print novel from St. Martin's Press. During the editorial process, significant changes and improvements were made to Descent's print manuscript. Character names were changed, and events at the end of the print novel were modified in ways that will impact the rest of the print trilogy. The print novel represents an official reboot of the 7th Son series.

Due to these changes, this ""Beta Version"" of Book One: Descent is no longer the ""official"" version of the podiobook. Please visit the 7th Son: Descent (The Print Edition) page to subscribe to the definitive version of the story.

THE STORY
Three weeks ago, the U.S. president was murdered by a four-year-old boy.

Today, seven men stare at each other in a locked conference room. Kidnapped and brought to this underground facility, the strangers are sitting in silence, thunderstruck. Despite minor physical differences, they all appear to be the same man, with the same name ... and the same childhood memories.

Unwitting participants in a secret human cloning experiment, these seven ""John Michael Smiths"" have been gathered by their creators for one reason -- to capture the mastermind behind the president's assassination.

Their target? The man they were cloned from; the original John Michael Smith, code-named John Alpha.

Soon our heroes -- John, Jack, Michael, Kilroy2.0 and the others -- realize the president's murder was merely a prologue to Alpha's plans. As the mystery deepens and the implications of Alpha's scheme are slowly revealed, the clones decide to stand against John Alpha. The outcome will unearth a conspiracy larger than they could have ever imagined.

Descent is the first novel in J.C. Hutchins' 7th Son thriller trilogy."

Grimms' Fairy Tales by Jacob & Wilhelm Grimm	"Talking animals, wicked stepmothers, valiant tailors, cruel witches! Sixty-two stories that feature familiar figures like Hansel and Gretel, Rapunzel, Rumplestiltskin, The Twelve Dancing Princesses and Snow-White and Rose Red as well as lesser-known characters like The White Snake, Sweetheart Roland and Clever Elsie are contained in this volume of Grimms' Fairy Tales by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm. 

The original volume published in 1812 contained more than 85 tales and this number kept increasing till it got to the seventh edition which contained more than two hundred stories. Initially the authors meant the collection to be read not just by children, but also adults and was meant to be a compilation of folk-tales that had been passed down orally for generations. The first edition was packed with scholarly foot-notes and interesting information about the cultural connotations of each story. Later, the authors were persuaded to change the format and make it suitable for children.

However, many of these stories were found by publishers to be far too gruesome for young readers. Objectionable passages and scenes of violence were removed and replaced with less fearsome ones. The scholarly foot notes were completely eliminated, making the book just a collection of fairy tales that a child might enjoy. The present collection contains some of the most famous and well loved fairy tales that generations of children have enjoyed. The universal themes of fairy tales which include the triumph of good over evil, courage, common-sense, humility, love, the downfall of pride, greed, envy and laziness all find voice in the characters of Grimms' Fairy Tales. 

Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were two brothers born in Frankfurt in the old German kingdom of Hesse. They studied law, but were passionately interested in folklore. Jacob was also a philologist studying language. Though Wilhelm's ill-health made traveling difficult, they toured Germany and neighboring European countries in the 18th century documenting folk tales commonly recounted by word of mouth in small villages and communities. Their interest in preserving these historical examples of native wisdom and culture has made it possible for modern readers to enjoy these age old stories that were told and retold by countless grandparents to generations of grandchildren. Most of the stories retain the lyrical qualities of oral tradition and are meant to be read aloud, creating a magical world for children. 

This treasure trove of stories has become an essential part of the bed-time ritual of story-telling for both parents and children all over the world."
